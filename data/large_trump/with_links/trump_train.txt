A really big show tonight by @seanhannity  9:00 P.M. @FoxNews  Heavy emphasis on the Impeachment Hoax. The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have gone crazy. They know it‚Äôs a con but just can‚Äôt sell it! Public strongly against Impeachment.
House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign &amp; Russia. (2)  The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.
A total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected U.S. Pastor Andrew Brunson from prison. He has been held hostage far too long. @RT_Erdogan should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband &amp; father. He has done nothing wrong and his family needs him!
I said simply that the Mexican leaders and negotiators are smarter than ours and that the Mexican gov't is pushing their hard core to U.S.
The only ‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù is that of the Democrats with Russia and many others. Why didn‚Äôt the FBI take the Server from the DNC? They still don‚Äôt have it. Check out how biased Facebook Google and Twitter are in favor of the Democrats. That‚Äôs the real Collusion!

Approval Rating in Republican Party = 95% a Record! Overall Approval Rating = 51%. Think of where I‚Äôd be without the never ending 24 hour a day phony Witch Hunt that started 3 years ago!

Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!
If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible!
The lobbyists &amp; special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me "just a little" but is very false!
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.
If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33000 illegally deleted emails perhaps they should share them with the FBI!
