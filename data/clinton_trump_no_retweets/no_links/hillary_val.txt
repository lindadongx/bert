Proud to have you on this team, @StephenCurry30.  
Congratulations on becoming a U.S. citizen, Alicia. Enjoy casting that vote. 
LGBT kids are perfect the way they are. They deserve love and acceptance—not bullying and violence. 
Trump's global web of financial and business ties would compromise our national security if he’s elected president. 
This is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for those who look or love or worship one way—for all.
We can do a lot to help working parents. Join a Facebook Q&amp;A on Hillary's new child care plan at 3pm ET: 
"No matter where life takes me I always remember I am the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small business owner."
This wasn't an anomaly for Trump. His economic plan helps millionaires and hurts middle-class families. He'd let Wall Street run wild again.
"When we come together...we won’t just win in November—we’ll build on the progress we’ve made." —@POTUS 
America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look or worship a certain way.

12. How can we be sure you'd be willing to be tough on any nation if necessary, if it would put your interests and profits at risk?
“The last time we opted for Trump-style isolationism, it made the Great Depression longer and more painful.” —Hillary
.@realdonaldtrump's bigoted comments about a Latino judge are so disgusting, even other Republicans are offended.
We watched the first night of the #RNCinCLE so you didn't have to. Some of the worst of what we heard: 
"I accept your nomination for president of the United States!” —Hillary 
Student debt and the cost of college are incredibly important.Why isn’t Donald Trump talking about these issues?
Text CONGRATS to 47246 to tell Hillary you're with her tonight. 
The Trump Atlantic City business method: Drive a business into the ground, stiff workers, and take home millions. 
The Trump Foundation: "an arrangement worked out for maximum benefit at minimum sacrifice.” 
The choice on jobs in this election (it’s not a hard one).

Donald Trump's plan on immigration has been clear all along: demonize immigrants, "build a wall," deport millions. 
We think Trump's been involved in more than 5,500 lawsuits. We're going to try and read them all in 4 hours: 
So proud of you, Karla.
The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can't be unwritten.
Trump has banished members of the press who have criticized him.Is there any doubt he would do the same as president?
“He says he cares about the middle class?Give me a break. That’s a bunch of malarkey." —@JoeBiden on Donald Trump
"She exposes [Trump] for what he is: temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president." —Hillary on @elizabethforma

"I think I've made a lot of sacrifices." —Trump's response to the parents of Humayun Khan, who died serving in Iraq

"NY elected her to the seat once held by another outsider, Robert Kennedy. She didn’t let him down.” —@BillClinton on Hillary’s Senate run

Some of the (many, many) reasons Donald Trump isn't fit to be Commander-in-Chief. 
It’s past time for comprehensive immigration reform, and we’re going to do everything we can to get it done: 
Getting countries to work together takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults by dropping in for a few hours, then flying home.
"Our elections should be shaped by voters' voices—not bought and sold by corporations &amp; special interests" —Hillary: 
"Speaking is hard for me, but come January, I want to say these two words: Madam President." —@

Donald Trump proves every day that he’s not in it for the American people—he’s in it only for himself. 
We made history tonight—but we have more work to do. Chip in if you've got Hillary's back: 
Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. What that would mean: his family gets a $4 billion tax cut. 99.8% of Americans get nothing.
Again, Trump turns his faults on others. Psychologists call it "projecting." Kids call it "I'm rubber, you're glue." 
We don't just believe in a country where no one is left out or left behind—we're making it a reality.
"We can build on a strong progressive tradition from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama." —Hillary

Don’t let anyone tell you that America isn’t great. Donald Trump’s got America all wrong.
In America, it doesn’t matter where your parents were born or what color your skin is. We should be judged by words and deeds—not our race.
Taking care of our veterans is part of our solemn duty as Americans:  
Trump's dangerously wrong when he says “I alone can fix it.”Americans haver never put our faith in one man—we put our faith in each other.
What our economy needs: The largest investment in creating good-paying jobs since World War II. 
Trump's called for a new tax loophole—the Trump Loophole. He'd pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies.

We need a president who will unite leaders around the world to defeat ISIS, not one who insults and alienates them. 
"When I’m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can’t." Hillary in NC today: 
Anyone who looks at the African American community and sees only poverty, crime, and despair is missing so much. 
Trump is attacking a judge based on his heritage because Trump thinks *he's* the victim of bias here. 
Hillary's new college plan will help more students, especially students of color, afford college: 
Paid family leave isn't a luxury. Families shouldn't have to choose between eating and caring for loved ones. 
We need to start listening to each other.Hearing each other.Walking in each other’s shoes.
Does Trump pay his fair share in taxes? As long as he keeps refusing to release his tax returns, voters won't know. 
In the spirit of the #Charleston9, let’s bridge our divides, fight for change, and remember that love never fails. 
“The only thing standing between Donald Trump and the Oval Office is all of us.” —Hillary

We are not a post-racial society. We still struggle with racism—and it's not only wrong, it's holding us back.
This week, Trump attacked a fallen soldier's family, called Hillary "the devil," and criticized a crying baby.
Today's #SCOTUS decision upholding reproductive rights is a major victory—but we can't take it for granted.
