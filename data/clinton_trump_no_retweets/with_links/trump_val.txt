Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!
I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster. We can do much better!
Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous? https://t.co/UdwqF4iZIZ
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
"@mai_Ttag:  Great interview! Happy you had a chance to show the other side of you. Never change, never forget you are our messenger!"
The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!
.@YoungDems4Trump  Thank you!
I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.
Russia has more warheads than ever, N Korea is testing nukes, and Iran got a sweetheart deal to keep theirs. Thanks, @HillaryClinton.
Failing @NYTimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very sad!

"@ladytsbrug: Lovely interview, Mr. Trump! @realDonaldTrump" Thanks.
Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize?
@MELANIATRUMP did great on television this morning. Poised, smart and strong, with a big heart - so much to offer. We are all proud of you!
