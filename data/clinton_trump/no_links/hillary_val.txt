Virginia's own @timkaine has joined Team Hillary—now it's your turn:  #VirWINia 
Donald Trump doesn't represent us.His ideas don't represent us.And his values don't represent us.Add your name:

Dear Donald: You can't make America great again when you don't make things in America.
We can't let @realDonaldTrump become our next president.  
None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country alone. It takes a village.

It'd be all too easy for Trump to roll back the progress we've made on LGBT rights. We can't give him the chance.
