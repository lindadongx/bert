Dear Donald: You can't make America great again when you don't make things in America.
We can't let @realDonaldTrump become our next president.  
None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country alone. It takes a village. 
We know Donald Trump is not who we are. If you want to shut him down, then let’s vote him down. 
As @FLOTUS said, this election is about what kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations.

"It is not enough to be on the money. You need to be making the money." —Hillary on ensuring equal pay for women
It'd be all too easy for Trump to roll back the progress we've made on LGBT rights. We can't give him the chance.

There is clear evidence that black Americans are more likely to be killed in police incidents than any other group. We have to do better.
