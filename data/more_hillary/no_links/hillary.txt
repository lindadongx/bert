Donald Trump's plan on immigration has been clear all along: demonize immigrants, "build a wall," deport millions. 
We think Trump's been involved in more than 5,500 lawsuits. We're going to try and read them all in 4 hours: 
So proud of you, Karla.

Some of the (many, many) reasons Donald Trump isn't fit to be Commander-in-Chief.

Donald Trump proves every day that he’s not in it for the American people—he’s in it only for himself. 
We made history tonight—but we have more work to do. Chip in if you've got Hillary's back: 
Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. What that would mean: his family gets a $4 billion tax cut. 99.8% of Americans get nothing.
Again, Trump turns his faults on others. Psychologists call it "projecting." Kids call it "I'm rubber, you're glue."

"We can build on a strong progressive tradition from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama." —Hillary

Don’t let anyone tell you that America isn’t great. Donald Trump’s got America all wrong.
In America, it doesn’t matter where your parents were born or what color your skin is. We should be judged by words and deeds—not our race.
Taking care of our veterans is part of our solemn duty as Americans:  
Trump's dangerously wrong when he says “I alone can fix it.”Americans haver never put our faith in one man—we put our faith in each other.
What our economy needs: The largest investment in creating good-paying jobs since World War II. 
Trump's called for a new tax loophole—the Trump Loophole. He'd pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies.

We need a president who will unite leaders around the world to defeat ISIS, not one who insults and alienates them. 
"When I’m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can’t." Hillary in NC today: 
Anyone who looks at the African American community and sees only poverty, crime, and despair is missing so much. 
Trump is attacking a judge based on his heritage because Trump thinks *he's* the victim of bias here. 
Hillary's new college plan will help more students, especially students of color, afford college: 
Paid family leave isn't a luxury. Families shouldn't have to choose between eating and caring for loved ones. 
We need to start listening to each other.Hearing each other.Walking in each other’s shoes.
Does Trump pay his fair share in taxes? As long as he keeps refusing to release his tax returns, voters won't know. 
In the spirit of the #Charleston9, let’s bridge our divides, fight for change, and remember that love never fails.

You don't have to be LGBT to stand with the LGBT community. We all have a stake in equality. Thank you, Michael. 
Trump would abolish this bedrock constitutional principle: if you’re born in the U.S., you’re an American citizen. 
Someone as detached from reality as Donald Trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
In a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside-in and the inside-out.
Rosa Parks opened up every seat on the bus. Now we’ve got to expand economic opportunity so everyone can afford the fare.
No matter what Donald Trump says, America is great, and the American Dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise.
To every little girl who dreams big: Yes, you can be anything you want—even president. Tonight is for you. -H

"I’ve seen her judgment, toughness, and commitment to our values up close. ... I'm with her." —@POTUS

A progressive who gets things done? Make that two.  
Republican leaders should take a look at who they're standing with. 
"We will not build a wall—instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one." —Hillary
Donald hasn't given his own money to the Trump Foundation since 2008—but it's still paying his bills. 
We need to work together to keep our country and our citizens safe.None of this will be helped by anything Trump has to offer.
We’re stronger together. When we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them. When we build bridges, not walls.

Today's attack in Baghdad is another horrific example of ISIS's savagery. We will defeat them. My prayers are with the victims' families. -H
Your potential next president on building a wall... And bathrooms.
To make a better future for our kids, we've got to protect the future of our planet. Happy Earth Day. 
"I think Hillary will go down as one of the finest secretaries of state we've had." –@POTUS Trump's campaign is bragging that not paying taxes makes him a "genius."What kind of genius loses $1 billion in a single year?
Alabama, California, South Dakota: Your deadline to register to vote is today. Time to check your voter registration and get your friends and family to do the same. 
Amazing update: Together, we've raised over $500,000 in the past 48 hours for groups working to protect children at the border. The Trump administration’s cruelty has caused a moral and humanitarian crisis for every American. Thank you for responding with compassion and action.

Lost in the news this week: A 40-year-old man died in CBP custody on Monday. He is the fourth person to die in detention in recent months. The other fatalities include a 7-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy. Congress must investigate conditions. 
Virginia just became the 33rd state to pass Medicaid expansion. 400,000 lives will be improved by giving people access to health insurance.Bold ideas matter.Democratic values matter.Elections matter.

"All the progress we've made these last 8 years is on the ballot." —@POTUSMake sure you're ready to vote: 
I wrote a Facebook post about a decision I made 10 years ago, what’s changed, &amp; on an issue you didn’t hear a single word about tonight. Take a look. 
We are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore. That is not working for us.  
Progress is on the ballot.

Hillary's been called a lot of things over the years. "Quitter" isn't one of them.  
“If you elect me next Tuesday, that is the kind of president I will be.”  
Congratulations to @OnwardTogether partner @SwingLeft and grantee @Flippable_org for joining forces! After helping to flip dozens of seats in 2018, I'm thrilled they're uniting to target key state and congressional seats in this redistricting year. 
We can help these children get the help they deserve. And we can send a message to the administration that we won't stand for this. We just won’t. #CloseTheCamps
The title of this new book really says it all: "Somebody's Gotta Do It: Why Cursing at the News Won't Save the Nation, But Your Name on a Local Ballot Can." 
"Tomorrow is the election, but that is just the beginning." —Hillary  
Any human being can spread the virus, whether they’re a citizen or a permanent resident or a green card applicant or a refugee. Disease doesn’t discriminate, but this administration certainly does.
Eleven weeks ago, the administration was supposed to finish reunifying families it separated at the border. Eleven weeks on, families are still waiting and wondering when they'll see their loved ones again. Every additional minute they wait is an injustice.
"Most of them deserved it." —Donald  
Las Vegas, we are grieving with you—the victims, those who lost loved ones, the responders, &amp; all affected by this cold-blooded massacre.
There are excellent candidates running all over the country who will raise wages, bring down health-care costs, fight for justice, and provide some much-needed congressional oversight of the White House. Make sure you're ready to vote for them.
Today is the final day to sign up for 2018 health coverage. Go to  and get covered! 
These organizations are recruiting a new Democratic bench, defending rights, and organizing locally to fight for progressive policies that improve people's lives. I'm so proud.
Join me for a Broadway play (and some chardonnay) to support the work @OnwardTogether partners are doing to further democracy and fight for our values. Throw your hat in the ring here:  
"You have a chance to elect a woman, our first female president, who has spent her entire life moving this country forward.” —@POTUS
The facts are clear: Trump refuses to admit he is wrong on the Central Park jogger case and continues to peddle yet another racist lie. 
I strongly condemn today's attack in Jerusalem and my prayers go to the victims' families. The terrorists must be brought to justice. -H
"Tim is a good man. He’s a true progressive. And he will make a great vice president." —@POTUS on @TimKaine 
In 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Court upheld the consitutionality of the ACA. In 2017, he criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for ruling to uphold the law five years earlier.
RT if you agree we need to keep moving forward, not back.  
A year ago today, 17 families lost loved ones to gun violence that should never have happened. A community lost friends, teammates, and beloved coaches. Let's remember their stories today, as told by student journalists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High.  
It gets worse. During the campaign I warned that the Rs would come after social security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid &amp; now they are. Imagine buying a Rolex &amp; paying for it with money you saved to take care of your kids. That’s what Congress is doing w/ your tax dollars.
I called her today to tell her how proud I am of her and to make sure she knows what all women should: we deserve to be heard.
10 times Pence shrugged off or straight-up lied about what Trump has said and done at the #VPDebate: 
It's about time. Ladies, start your engines! 
"Remember, when they go low, we go high.” —@FLOTUS: 
We are at a fork in the road for reproductive rights in America. There has never been a more important moment to recommit to protecting access to a full range of health care—including safe and legal abortion—for all. 
.@IndivisibleTeam @swingleft @ColorOfChange @EmergeAmerica @runforsomething @GovHowardDean This year hasn't been what I envisioned, but I know what I'm still fighting for: a kinder, big-hearted, inclusive America. Onward!
I burst out laughing when I saw this video this morning. Hope it brightens your day. 
Family separation profoundly harms children and their parents and we must oppose attempts to continue it at every turn.  #familiesbelongtogether
"I want every public college and university to be tuition-free for every family making less than $125,000 a year.” —Hillary in Cleveland
Congresswoman Louise Slaughter was a tireless advocate for her constituents in New York. She showed me the ropes when I was first elected to the Senate in 2000, &amp; did the same for so many of our colleagues. I was lucky to call her a friend. She will be missed.
A new report from the @TXCivilRights Project has found shocking proof that the Trump administration lied about ending its inhumane policy of separating families at the border. Hundreds more separations have occurred. This is outrageous. 
Text JOIN to 47246 and get involved because the bigger the turnout, the bigger the statement we’ll make about the kind of country we are.
Grateful to everyone who performed and turned out at #BroadwayForHillary. A great reminder about how important it is to vote. -H 
"LGBT kids don’t need to be cured of anything. They just need to be accepted and loved and embraced.” —Hillary
Sign Hillary's birthday card to wish her a great (and historic) year to come: 
With just 8 days left, this can’t wait. RT if you agree Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to Russia. 
Statues are powerful things. When we cast figures in bronze, we immortalize their contributions to history.It took far too long for Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to join Central Park's 23 male statues, but I'm so glad we're finally here. 
"I feel very, very angry. So much so that it still evokes anger and hurt." —Mae Wiggins, on experiencing discrimination by Trump's company 
This year has seen record-high temperatures across the world, the biggest wildfire in California history, and an unprecedented red tide in Florida. It's urgent that we act to curb climate change—and Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court could make progress virtually impossible.
Above all, we need to find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and rekindle our civic spirit. We need to bring back civics education in our schools. We need systemic economic reforms that reduce inequality and give a strong voice to working families.
“If Hillary doesn’t win this election, that will be on us.” —@FLOTUSDon't let that happen:  
And they're just getting started. You can support the @CGIU program here: 
Like clockwork, where Democrats win, Republicans seek to put new restrictions on voting. We have to be vigilant in the fight to protect and expand voting rights, law by law and state by state. 
Good question.  
The Trump administration tried to bury a federally-mandated climate change study by releasing it the Friday after Thanksgiving. Here's what they didn't want you to hear:
My heart goes out to Paris. Notre Dame is a symbol of our ability as human beings to unite for a higher purpose—to build breathtaking spaces for worship that no one person could have built on their own. I wish France strength and shared purpose as they grieve and rebuild.
Time to make the churros at Kreamy Ice Cream Shop in Puerto Rico. @ClintonGlobal and @Foundation_PR are working together to deploy $1.2 million in grants to local entrepreneurs as small businesses continue to recover from Hurricane Maria. 
"Trump...tarnish[es] almost everyone around him because to work with him, they have to defend the indefensible."

Keith, who brings his mother with Alzheimer's to work with him because he can’t afford care for her during the day. 
"Every single one of us has something to contribute to this great country.” —Hillary 
We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take climate change seriously and are ready to take it on.
That was quite a birthday surprise, @Adele. Loved the show last night! -H 
The president of the United States has betrayed our country. That’s not a political statement—it’s a harsh reality, and we must act. He is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free. I support impeachment.
More contributions mean more services, lawyers, and advocates for kids and families in need, so please continue to spread the donation link far and wide. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
.@GretchenWhitmer never backs down from tackling the problems facing Michigan’s working families, and she was a key leader in addressing Detroit’s financial crisis. The Flint water crisis was a powerful motivator in Gretchen’s decision to jump in the race. 
A (non-exhaustive) list of all the terrible things Donald Trump has said about women: 
.@FLOTUS is with her. Are you?  
Babies should not be in detention. “At least nine infants younger than a year old, including one who is just 5 months old, are being held in ICE custody at a rural Texas detention center without care that's legally required.” 
Fighting against inhumane conditions at the border is a matter of conscience and law. A federal asylum officers' union argues the administration is forcing them to break their oaths by following orders contrary to domestic and international law. 
Ryan is still endorsing Trump. 
“We know the difference between leadership and dictatorship, and the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart.”
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans rushed to pass so-called tax reform - a giveaway for those who least need it.
Our veterans and military families deserve better than what Donald Trump says about them. 
Thanks to @parentsmagazine for a great chat about what it was like to work on It Takes A Village with @MarlaFrazee. 
Let resistance plus persistence equal progress…here was my message to Democrats today.
“There is just no space to be anything but optimistic even in this moment of horror and disappointment in our leaders because we’ve had leaders like Eleanor Roosevelt before and we will again." When your daughter says it better than you ever could. Chelsea, I'm so proud of you. 
“If he doesn’t respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?” —Hillary on Trump
In this cycle, Native Americans are scrambling for IDs because of a new voting law that requires them to use identification that lists a street address rather than a P.O. box, which many who live on reservations have used for years. 
Such a lovely night in LA—thanks to everyone who came out to talk gutsy women with us! 
On average, Latinas make only $0.54 for each $1 white men earn. Time to close that gap. #LatinaEqualPay 
.@LatinoVictoryUS is dedicated to electing Latino candidates to all levels of government, building Latino political power, and "making Trump furious."
It is our obligation as Americans to dig deep in doing whatever we can to build the kind of future we want for ourselves—and our children. 
Nobody should wake up on November 9 and wonder whether there is more you could have done. 
"Hillary...crushed Donald Trump in the most effective series of debate performances in modern political history." 
We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear each other down. 
In one week, we have the chance to flip 17 governorships from red to blue. Here are four incredible candidates who deserve your support:
I stand with the people of Puerto Rico as they protest the corruption and disgraceful behavior of their government. Like all Americans, they have the fundamental right—and duty—to hold their leaders to account.
Study after study shows that one of the best ways to get out the vote is to talk to potential voters in person the week before the election. It's not too late to sign up to help, and to bring a friend along with you: 
Five women older than their right to vote share why they're with Hillary:

Right now, we're ceding the future at great cost to ourselves and our people but also to the great delight of our competitors and our adversaries. At the @ClintonCenter yesterday, we talked about how the policies of the 90s can help inform the way forward. 
Such a terrific day visiting @ClintonFdn partners in Puerto Rico who are working on disaster resilience and recovery. The goals: building back better and #PuttingPeopleFirst. Tune in to  over the next few days for more on this work and how you can plug in. 
Mass shootings are not inevitable. The majority of Americans support common sense gun reform. Though we feel angry, heartbroken, even helpless now, we have the power to elect people who will protect lives, not gun sellers’ profits. Remember these feelings in November, and VOTE.
A man who bullies and shames a woman for her weight should never become president. 
We'll be in Seattle tonight with @WhitfordBradley! In addition to famously playing a White House staffer on TV, Bradley is a progressive activist in real life and I’m looking forward to chatting about what we can all do to help Democrats win in 2020. See you all soon.

Yesterday, FBI Director Comey bowed to partisan pressure and released a vague and inappropriate letter to Congress. What you need to know: 
.@FLOTUS is “someone who reminds us to work hard, stay true to our values, and never stop fighting for what we believe in." —Hillary
Leaders around the world should treat the new @IPCC_CH report as a call to arms. We have barely 10 years to ward off catastrophic warming with destabilizing effects for all of us. Our children and grandchildren deserve action, and action now. 
It’s Election Day and polls are officially open. When will you vote today? Confirm where to go here:

Our friends at @IndivisibleTeam report that their local groups made more than 600,000 calls into the Commonwealth to help elect @RalphNortham @FairfaxJustin @MarkHerringVA.
Trump called Latinos "bad hombres" on Wednesday. It's not even the most insulting thing he said about the community. 
Can you imagine how different our policies would be if more working moms and dads were part of making them? That's why I'm calling on the FEC to allow candidates to use campaign funds for childcare when they’re on the trail. 
Hillary has earned nearly every newspaper endorsement of the general election. Here's why: 
"More than 31 million people have already voted early." —HillaryJoin them → 
Our democracy is in crisis. In just one week, we as citizens have the chance to pull it back from the brink. Let's wake up on November 7 and know that we did everything we could in this last week to win. Don't just vote this year—volunteer. 
No one who wants to be Commander-in-Chief should be calling active military operations a "disaster.” 
The U.N. Secretary General said this week that the point of no return for the climate crisis "is no longer over the horizon. It is in sight and hurtling toward us.” I'm proud to be part of @johnkerry's new @WorldWarZeroOrg to win this fight. Join us: 
We have a choice between taking serious steps to combat climate change—and refusing to admit it even exists. 
Yes, Trump and Pence are running an insult-driven campaign.Donald's literally doing it right now. #
.@BarackObama is right.This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics.Speak out against this bill.
A few weeks before Kavanaugh's name appeared on President Trump's short list for a new justice, Kavanaugh praised the dissent in the Roe v. Wade case and called former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist his “hero,” noting that “he clearly wanted to overrule Roe.”
"I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election."Every American should read this whistleblower complaint.

"We truly are stronger together — and together, we’re going to make history."A note from Hillary: 
Share this if you know someone who needs to see it.  
No matter which issue you care about most—health care, education, climate change, or holding a lawless president to account, just for example—one of the most important things you can do today to further that cause is register a friend to vote.  #VoteReady
"You want to give me a good send-off? Go vote!" —@POTUS  
Live from Toledo: Watch Hillary speak on her plan to make the economy work for everyone—not just those at the top. 
At Monday's debate, Trump denied saying a lot of the things he's said. Let's set the record straight. 
And to this young woman. Every day that we refuse to act, we are failing them. 
Actually, @mike_pence, your running mate did say that.  #VPDebate 
I stand by this assessment. 
"The reporter and I have the same condition. When Mr. Trump made fun of him, that hurt my feelings." 
On Tuesdays, we wear patterns. Thank you for a great conversation, Emma! 
"About half of the people he wants to deport—they’ve paid more taxes than Donald Trump has paid.” —Hillary in Arizona

I'm excited to see @CecileRichards, @aliciagarza, @aijenpoo, and the Pantsuit Nation community build this powerful new force for gender equity. Supermajority's goal is to train and mobilize 2 million women over the next two years. 
To fix our broken democracy, we need automatic voter registration, early voting for everyone, and less money in politics. The House passed the #ForThePeopleAct to make those changes. Now it's up to the Senate. Ask your senators to co-sponsor the bill: 
There's nothing American about tearing families apart.We need to elect politicians who will protect the vulnerable. But these kids can't wait for a new Congress in November. Donate today to the organizations leading the fight to protect these kids.

Advancing the rights of women and girls is the great unfinished business of the 21st century and no one has done more to push it into reality than Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I was delighted to help honor her at the 2020 DVF Awards. 
Incredible.  
To Donald, women like Alicia are only as valuable as his personal opinion about their looks.  
Even if Trump's bullying, bigotry, and misogyny weren't disqualifying, his policies would be.

The next several weeks may be some of the hardest we’ve faced as a country. From those on the front lines to those saving lives by staying at home, let’s remember to be kind to each other, be patient, and remember the power of our collective humanity, even when we’re apart.
.@RunForSomething co-founders @RossMoRock and @amandalitman are right: We can't just win the White House. Down-ballot races this year will determine the next decade of power.
“Hillary has done her job. Now we need to do our job and get her elected president of the United States.” —@FLOTUS 
My prayers go out to everyone grieving the tragic loss of @RachelHeldEvans. She lived a life of generosity, justice-seeking, and inclusive faith. So many people were touched by her voice and her example. What a life and what a legacy.

The committee to elect Democratic attorneys general has announced it will only support candidates who publicly commit to protecting reproductive rights. This is a powerful, positive policy change to advance justice and equal rights. 
Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people. How do you even begin to quantify that? 
More than 4,600 lives lost in Puerto Rico. 70x the official number. The US gov’t has failed its own citizens. The response itself is an American tragedy.Hurricane season is about to begin in Puerto Rico. The administration must step up &amp; protect its people.

@AndrewGillum @realDonaldTrump I can handle it. Blessed with stamina. And thankfully I didn’t stay up late last night watching InfoWars...
With a historic number of women running this year, we have a tremendous opportunity to make our government better reflect our country. We'd all be lucky to see these four extraordinary candidates win their races for Congress this fall:

He did promise "America First." 
"Don't boo, vote! Booing doesn't do any good. Vote, and get your friends to vote.” —@POTUS 
Remember, Georgia: If you’re in line when the polls close at 7pm, you can still cast a ballot—so stay in line and vote! While the GOP has been trying to make this election about anything but the future you want for your families, you are on the verge of making history.

Congrats to the great @barb_kinney on her new book collecting her photos from the campaign trail in 2016. She captured the joy and exhaustion and energy of it all, from late nights on the plane to being backstage with Beyoncé. Out November 1st! 
This week, the Justice Department determined that the lies that were peddled about me, my family, &amp; @ClintonFdn are without merit. I couldn’t be more grateful to everyone that stuck with us while we continued to focus on the work. Let’s keep going. 
That feeling when you win three straight debates. #DebateNight 
As Trump makes an unprecedented attack on our democracy, millions of people are registering and voting early.

I have always been and remain a staunch advocate of comprehensive immigration reform that’s true to our values and treats every person with dignity, provides a pathway to full and equal citizenship…
Do you have a pre-existing condition? Do you care about someone who has one? Could you or someone you love ever get one? Then you should call your senators today to #StopKavanaugh from getting a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. Here's why: 
@realDonaldTrump That’s a clip from when Medvedev was president. Here’s what I said about Putin’s Russia. 
.@TimKaine wears his "F" rating from the @NRA like a badge of honor. 
At last night's debate, Trump showed again and again that he doesn't have a clue about what makes America great. 
Winning back state legislatures is also important in this last election before the 2020 Census. State legislatures redraw congressional districts every 10 years based on those numbers, and Democratic legislative majorities can shut down gerrymandering that disenfranchises voters.
In 2019, every day is Endangered Species Day. We have to act now to prevent the loss of 1 million species over the next few decades—losses that would have a profound effect on human beings. 
Vladimir Putin has waged a 30-year campaign to disrupt world events, including our last election. I talked about it in @ActMeasuresDoc, a fascinating summation of the Russia story that premieres today:

“This is not me just going through the motions here.I really, really, really want to elect Hillary.” —@POTUS:  
"We really are just trying to make our mark in life by helping people." 
Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.
Where was this kind of comedy last night? 
11 days to go and Hillary’s on the trail in Iowa. Tune in now:  make a plan to vote: 
We must defend our democracy, and the painful truth is that the occupant of the Oval Office is waging war against it. 
“The reason a lot of [Ku Klux] Klan members like Donald Trump is because a lot of what he believes, we believe in.” 
Our democracy is built on fair elections and peaceful transfer of power. Trump can't threaten that just because he can't handle reality. 
Twenty-five years after 189 countries adopted a plan to advance women's rights at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, we've made progress. But there's still much to do.

Our children and grandchildren will look back at the choice we make on Tuesday. Let's make them proud.  
I introduced reproductive rights sections to the reports while I was secretary of state because access to reproductive health care is a protected human right affecting women's right to life, equality, and freedom from inhumane treatment.

How is it that in the middle of dividing up $1.5 trillion dollars between corporations &amp; the ultra-wealthy, Republicans can’t find the time &amp; money to take care of children? These are perverse priorities. Congress needs to pass CHIP now, as they have every year since the 1990s.

George H.W. Bush was a beloved father &amp; grandfather, a war hero, a public servant, &amp; a class act. In my experiences w/ him, I always valued his desire to listen, look at evidence &amp; ask for ideas, even from people w/ different beliefs. My heart goes out to the entire Bush family.
We have to be better than this. Make sure your representatives continue to hear from you that families belong together, and give what you can to the efforts to reunite these children with their families.
An excellent Q&amp;A with @DrLeanaWen of Planned Parenthood touching on the crisis of rising maternal mortality rates in America and why the fight to save reproductive choice is more pressing than ever. I admit to being partial to the interviewer.

State legislature races are also a great way to make an impact as an activist. The budgets and walk lists are smaller than those of congressional races, so you can move the needle with a few volunteer hours or donations.
If you're angry and ready for change, there's a concrete way to fight back: help candidates with progressive values win their elections on November 6th. Here are some excellent @runforsomething-endorsed candidates who deserve your support:

"Nobody can fully know what it’s like to manage a global crisis…but I tell you nobody’s been closer to those decisions than Hillary” —@POTUS 
Trump "doesn’t look at us as full human beings, with our dreams and our purposes, our own capabilities.” 
On #WorldEnvironmentDay, I’m feeling inspired by the work to build climate resilience that USVI, PR, and Caribbean communities shared at the @ClintonGlobal Action Network Meeting. This fight has many fronts, and people are coming together to take them on. 
"Whew, OK!” 
For #InternationalWomensDay, I'm issuing you a challenge. We know that when women run for office, they're elected at the same rate as men. But not as many women run as men—often because people don't ask women to run as often as they ask men.
The next president could appoint up to three Supreme Court justices.Will they protect Americans' rights, or corporations'? #debate

Hillary’s college plan will help students preparing for college, those already in school, and those paying off debt. 
Just spent a great evening with two of my favorite authors discussing their new book, The President is Missing. It’s a page-turner! Check it out: 
There are hundreds of thousands more @AmeriCorps applications than spots. Horrible! Let's expand it from 75,000 annual members to 250,000.
We’re going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families making less than $125,000 a year. 
Despite what this White House claims, separating families is not mandated by law. That is an outright lie, and it’s incumbent on all of us – journalists and citizens alike – to call it just that.
Only 0.1% of all elected officials in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ. Representation matters! For National #OutToWin Day, take a moment to ask a talented community leader or organizer to consider running for office:

Trump lost last night's debate before he even took the stage, and it only got worse from there. 
"Donald, I did enjoy listening to your speech…I’m sure I’ll enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny you ever gave it." —Hillary #AlSmithDinner
A story appeared today about something that happened in 2008. I was dismayed when it occurred, but was heartened the young woman came forward, was heard, and had her concerns taken seriously and addressed.

With two mass shootings in America in less than 24 hours, thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need action. The House has sent common-sense gun safety legislation to the Senate. Demand that @senatemajldr and your Republican elected officials join Democrats to pass it.
Sen. Kennedy, why are you parroting Russian propaganda that U.S. intelligence officials tell us are designed to divide our country? Did you miss the briefing that day? 
Even Mike Pence couldn’t defend the terrible things Trump’s said and done—so instead, he lied about them. 
Indeed. Bill &amp; I have you in our thoughts &amp; look forward to you both being back on your feet soon, wild socks &amp; all. -H 
Comparing 30 years of public service with…Trump. 
In less than a week, there will be a run-off in the race to be Georgia's next secretary of state. Georgians deserve a secretary of state who will administer elections fairly and make it easy for every eligible citizen to vote. Help make it happen:

"No matter what they throw at us in these last days, we won’t back down. We won’t be distracted.” —Hillary: 
Por favor comparte: 
My take on Trump and his cronies spreading that doctored video of Nancy Pelosi: It's sexist trash. It's also a sign that Trump is running scared. 
“Strong men, men who are truly role models, don’t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful.” —@FLOTUS
I’ve thought a lot about the church massacre last Sunday. What can anyone say equal to the horror &amp; grief? We should act to prevent future killings by expanding &amp; fully funding background checks. 94% of Americans support them, it should be the law.
Where are the tests? 
Why would Putin want Trump to win?The nice things he’s said about him?His promise to adopt pro-Kremlin policies?Or his business dealings?
After a decade of amazing progress in combating deaths from malaria, progress has leveled off over the past few years. Malaria is an entirely preventable disease that kills a child every two minutes. This #WorldMalariaDay, let's renew our collective efforts to end it.

Carter.Bush.Clinton.Bush.Obama.Not one of them believes Donald Trump has what it takes to be president. 
Looking forward to this! 
Thank you so much for joining us, Sudaraka. A minor fact check—it's a new playlist! Team members Grady and Joy created it for the #gutsywomen tour and they really do have excellent taste. You can find it on Spotify here:  
There can be no sustainable peace in Afghanistan if women are not at the negotiating table. I was honored to join ambassadors, advocates, and @giwps at the @UN to make clear that Afghan women's rights must be protected in any peace negotiations or post-conflict aid packages. 
Kavanaugh would replace Justice Kennedy, who was the deciding vote in a pivotal 2007 Supreme Court case that established greenhouse gases were "well within" the EPA's authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act and made it possible for the agency to start reining in emissions.

The energy we're seeing on this campaign isn't about what we're against but what we're for—an inclusive America where everyone counts. 
The anniversary of the devastating earthquake 8 years ago is a day to remember the tragedy, honor the resilient people of Haiti, &amp; affirm America’s commitment to helping our neighbors. Instead, we‘re subjected to Trump’s ignorant, racist views of anyone who doesn’t look like him.
If Trump stands by what he said about women as “locker room talk,” he's clearly not sorry. 
On Election Day, let's show what it means to be stronger together:  
"Thankfully, Hillary is a policy wonk. And let me tell you, when you are president, that is a good thing.” —@FLOTUS 
In 2016, he argued that the Clean Air Act was a "thin statute" to support the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants.
It's appalling that a presidential nominee of a major party is undermining the pillar of our democracy—just because he hates losing. 
Russia’s interference in our elections will continue to threaten our democracy until Republicans join Democrats to stop it. @MichaelBennet’s new book shines a spotlight on this critical issue. Maybe we can all send a copy to @senatemajldr? 
Russians appear to be re-running their 2016 hacking playbook, once again to benefit Donald Trump. Will the media play along again? Will the GOP open the door again? Will the Russians help pick our POTUS again? 
Ask yourself: Is this man fit to be the next president of the United States? 
Things I learned today. 
"I am so excited that I finally get to vote for my mom in a few hours.” —@ChelseaClinton

Seeking asylum is a human right. We shouldn't charge fees to people who are fleeing persecution and violence.“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, but first give us $50?" No.

Along with @IndivisibleTeam, @ColorOfChange, @EmergeAmerica, @swingleft, and @runforsomething, I know these groups will continue to do the incredible work of making our democracy stronger in 2018, and I'm proud to be on their team.
"I know it seems a little odd for someone running for president to say we need more love and kindness in America." 
Whether it was stealing a Supreme Court seat, gerrymandering congressional districts to disenfranchise African Americans, or muzzling government climate scientists, Republicans were undermining American democracy long before Trump made it to the Oval Office.
Just yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance a measure that would require background checks for all gun sales and most gun transfers.Rep. @LucyMcBath, who lost a child to gun violence, cast her vote by saying: "For my son Jordan Davis, I vote aye."
As this remarkable piece of journalism reminds us, the ordeal for survivors of torture doesn’t end after they are freed. I’m honored to be giving the keynote at a celebration tomorrow of @heartlandhelps’ transformative work to help survivors heal.
Dr. Paul Farmer has forever changed the field of public health through his revolutionary approach. Hope you’ll tune in for this important conversation. 
From rivals to colleagues to friends. Hillary and @POTUS, in photos: 
"Progress is on the ballot.Civility is on the ballot.Tolerance is on the ballot.”—@POTUSGo vote: 
Remember. #Debate 
.@LucyWins2018 is a businesswoman and activist running for Congress in the 6th district of Georgia. After her son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed, Lucy turned her grief into action by fighting for both gun safety and criminal justice reform. 
Grateful to Planned Parenthood for continuing to provide essential services in Alabama and elsewhere while helping to fight the state legislative bans on women’s human and constitutional rights.

The administration is canceling “English classes, recreational programs and legal aid” for kids in migrant shelters, meaning facilities for children would be indistinguishable from prisons. Don't let them get away with it. 
@mr_taylor Congratulations, Mike! We're lucky to have you on the team. And thank you for registering to vote immediately. :)
I’m going to keep tweeting about this, and speaking out every chance I get, until it is fixed.
National service has always been a bipartisan goal. When it's hard to find common ground, it’s important we come together where we can.
Watch Hillary deliver remarks on the election from New York City: 
America is one of the oldest democracies in the world, and voting is our most sacred right as citizens. Let's make it easy for every single American to cast a ballot.
Stronger together. 
Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald.  #debate
Having an amazing day touring @ClintonGlobal sites in Puerto Rico. Started the day with @chefjoseandres at a Plow to Plate farm, one of many made possible through José's energy &amp; ingenuity and a CGI commitment. 
With just 19 days left in this campaign, @FLOTUS hits the trail for Hillary in Arizona. Watch live → 
"I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to António Guterres on his appointment as the next Secretary-General of the @UN." 
Every minute of Michelle Obama’s 30 minute speech today is worth watching. 
America lost a giant with the passing of Rep. Elijah Cummings, a man of principle who championed truth, justice and kindness. He fiercely loved his country and the people he served. Rest In Peace, my friend.
How do we go high? We vote:  
“I’m inspired by her heart, her persistence, and her guts.” —@FLOTUS on Hillary:  
Because I have a life you can't make up: as a young lawyer I worked on the Watergate impeachment inquiry. One of my jobs was to sit alone in a windowless room and listen very carefully to tapes of President Nixon’s phone calls. #tbt 
Like our amazing partners, we're just getting started. If you'd like to join our team, sign up here: 
Maybe there's a reason Donald Trump refuses to release a real plan to combat ISIS. #Debate 
"Today, I'm asking for your vote. Tomorrow, let's make history together." —Hillary  
Barcelona, you have our resolve and support in the face of this cowardly attack. We stand together against terrorism wherever it strikes.
We’ve seen GOP secretaries of state purge voter rolls and close voting sites. We should make it as easy as possible for every American to vote. Step 1: Help @iVoteFund elect Democratic secretaries of state. If you can, pitch in for the home stretch: 
What’s on the ballot this year:Our future.Our security.Our values.Who we are as a country.
Trump wants to give the biggest tax breaks in history to the super-wealthy and raise taxes on the middle class.We can't afford that.
"Dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot this election.” —Hillary 
At this rate, 1 in 8 homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, when kids born today are grandparents.
No one in America should die because they can't afford insulin. 
Earlier this year, Ryan Kyote used his allowance to help pay down his classmates' food service bills. He caught the attention of @GavinNewsom, who did this over the weekend. What a wonderful bright spot—would love to see more states follow suit.
A merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! 
Our progress is on the ballot.Tolerance is on the ballot.Democracy is on the ballot.Make a plan to vote:  
Pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal is a big mistake. It makes America less safe and less trusted. Iran is now more dangerous. What's plan B? Anyone who thinks bombing is the answer is woefully misinformed.
Bill and I will be traveling to Washington to pay our respects to President George H.W. Bush and his family at the funeral this week. We were greatly looking forward to being in Houston for our event this week, and are excited to come back next year as soon as we find a date.
This went under the radar last week, but we all need to speak out about it. The administration has moved to change decades-old rules so that they can hold migrant children in custody indefinitely. Right now, the detention limit for children is 20 days. 
Hillary's live in Cleveland talking about what we need to do to move our country forward. Watch here: 
This #GivingTuesday, consider giving to support organizations that have spent the last few months working tirelessly to reunite families the administration has separated at the border. Over 200 children are still waiting to be reunited with loved ones.
"I’m going to close my campaign the way I started my career…fighting for kids and families.” —Hillary 
“If you can be president of the United States, you can do anything.” —@TimKaine’s message to girls in America
Colin knows Hillary—not as first lady, secretary of state, or senator—but as his mom's best friend. Read his letter: 
I’m sending my condolences to all mourning the passing of Ralph Nesson. Ralph was a passionate advocate for families; we started the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship fund together in 1990, which has awarded 40,000 scholarships to single parents. May his memory be a blessing.
The 1990s were a period of unprecedented economic growth (h/t @BillClinton!). Tune in today to a conference Bill and I are hosting out of Little Rock to review what worked then and how we can all help now to build an economy that leaves no one behind. 
.@VotoLatino is working to engage Latinos in the civic process. They recently helped register 5,000 people in just one day at March For Our Lives events. Their goal: register 422,000 voters for the 2018 midterms and turn out 80% of those people.
Too many American children will never have the opportunity to realize their dreams because their lives were cut short by a bullet. Our kids deserve to live free from the threat of gun violence. #WearOrange @Everytown @MomsDemand 
Happy two-year anniversary to our @OnwardTogether partners. In two years, we’ve brought on 13 incredible groups as official partners and supported many more through grants.
Facebook's decision to allow false information in political advertisements is appalling. Voters are being confronted by millions of pieces of misinformation. A world where up is down and down is up is a world where democracy can't thrive.
This fight isn't over until it's over, and the only thing we can count on in this era is that these battles won't always end the way we expect they will. Share the number of the Senate switchboard with a friend right now: 202-224-3121
As the president's impeachment trial began, Republican senators pledged an oath to defend the Constitution.Today, 52 of them voted to betray that oath—and all of us.We’re entering dangerous territory for our democracy. It’ll take all of us working together to restore it.
In 2011, Hillary advised @POTUS on the mission to take out bin Laden. Trump was on the Apprentice.  #DebateNight 
“I’m going to double the child tax credit—that’s another $1,000 for young kids to pay for the things you need.”

It's Hillary's birthday! Don't forget to sign her card:  
A reality of a Supreme Court with a right-wing majority is that the states are a new important front in protecting civil rights—especially the rights of the most vulnerable among us.
“The choice that you make, that we make, will determine the direction of this country for a long time." —@POTUS:  
We’ve got to raise the minimum wage. No one who works full-time should still be in poverty. 
Spread the word: Some states have extended Affordable Care Act enrollment into January. Full list here:  
People are more likely to vote when their friends nudge them to vote. They're also more likely to vote when they have a plan to vote. So ask a friend today: "What's your plan to vote?"
Democracy works only when we accept that we’re in this together. We can’t just ask, “Am I better off than I was four years ago?” We have to ask, “Are we better off? Are we as a country better, stronger, and fairer?” Ultimately, healing our country will come down to each of us.
"Girls would grow up with a president who...brags about doing things to them without their consent." —Hillary on Donald Trump
"We don't disrespect women in our locker rooms." —@KingJames 
It'd been 100 years since @DispatchAlerts endorsed a Democrat for president—until now: 
Matthew’s parents, Judy and Dennis, lobbied hard for the Matthew Shepard &amp; James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act. They knew it wouldn't bring their son back, but they wanted other LGBT people to have that protection and justice. May their example inspire us all in these times.
Whatever he did, he did with his whole heart—whether he was running sprints, planning his wedding to the love of his life, rooting for his beloved Clemson Tigers, or working to build an America as kind, compassionate, and big-hearted as Tyrone himself.
Some photos from the book tour. I met so many incredible people, including some little heros, &amp; the occasional superhero... 
"It’s important to give you something to vote for, not just against." —Hillary  
However you serve, it feels great to be a part of something bigger than yourself—to work toward making something good happen in the world.
Let's celebrate New York State getting something important done that we wanted to do nationally. A great step for progressives. 
"Podemos demostrar que somos una comunidad poderosa. We can prove that we are a mighty community." —@SalmaHayek →  
Join Hillary for her last rally of the campaign in Raleigh, North Carolina: 
Trump suits were made in Mexico—he could have made them in Brooklyn, Ohio.Trump furniture is made in Turkey instead of Cleveland.
One thing's for sure: There's never a dull moment on political campaigns. Get in the mix—and help beat Trump in November—by applying to @orgcorps2020's one-week bootcamp for new organizers. Deadline tomorrow! 
Hillary just introduced a new plan to help lift families with children out of poverty: 
10 minutes of Donald Trump demeaning, objectifying, and insulting women.  
It’s not just our daughters we should raise as feminists. We should raise our sons as feminists, too. I got into why and how on the #YourPrimaryPlaylist podcast with @EmTSuss: 
“More than 3 million people have already voted, including many of you right here in Ohio.” —HillaryJoin them: 
This one's for you, Hillary. 
Words of advice from the 1969 @Wellesley College commencement speaker: Hillary Rodham.  
I want to be sure we're all clear about something that Brett Kavanaugh said in his confirmation hearings last week. He referred to birth-control pills as "abortion-inducing drugs." That set off a lot of alarm bells for me, and it should for you, too.
I’m thrilled to say the @OnwardTogether family is growing this winter with new partners. First up: @TXCivilRights, which works to advance equality and justice in Texas through legal advocacy and litigation. Head to  to be a part of their important work! 
Then, we need to do some housecleaning. Just as Nixon’s abuses of power led to reforms, post-Trump all future presidential candidates should be required by law to release their tax returns. They also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules.
@Hasbro Thank you. 🙏
“She said, ‘Do you want to sue Nazis with me? And I said, ‘Absolutely.’”So inspired by the dream team of @amyspitalnick, @kaplanrobbie, &amp; @karenleahdunn, who are taking on the structures of resurgent white supremacy with @IntegrityForUSA. 
Bernard Tyson spent his career working to help more people get access to more affordable health care. It’s a legacy to be proud of, and my thoughts are with his family, friends, and coworkers.
The abortion bans in Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, Kentucky, and Mississippi are appalling attacks on women's lives and fundamental freedoms. Women's rights are human rights. We will not go back.
If Donald is going to whine before the game is even over, he doesn’t have what it takes to do this job. #DebateNight
Millions of Americans work hard and pay their taxes. So why doesn't Donald Trump pay his? 
"His latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him.” —Hillary on Trump

This is exciting. @DrLeanaWen has dedicated her career to making sure vulnerable communities get access to the care they need, and she's the fighter we need to stand up to political attacks on women's health. 
From voter suppression to gerrymandering and foreign threats, American democracy is under assault. Tomorrow, I’ll talk solutions with @rweingarten, @EricHolder, @LeahGreenB, and more at an event from @ShankerInst, @AFTUnion, and @OnwardTogether. 
"He thinks we should be afraid of our Muslim brothers and sisters—because he has no idea who they really are." —@FLOTUS on Trump

"Can [Pence] look back on the debate as a success after he repeatedly lied in order to run interference for Trump?" 
"If you believe in science and that we have to act on climate change, then you have to vote!" —Hillary 
Child welfare officials in Texas are investigating the death of a young girl who died after alleged inadequate treatment while she was being held with her mother in a detention facility:

The National @DomesticWorkers Alliance has worked to protect domestic workers, immigrants, women, and their families for more than a decade, and I'm proud to say that NDWA has joined @OnwardTogether as an official partner.
"I'm casting my vote early for Hillary Clinton, and I urge you to vote early for Hillary, too." —@FLOTUS 
And if you live in New York state like I do, there are a lot of important races today, so go out and vote—I did!
The Roberts Court has dealt some big blows to workers and unions in the last few years. With Kavanaugh on the Court, a 5-4 hard-right majority would be even more aggressive in siding with corporations over people.
@Astrid_NV @iammarleydias @aijenpoo @domesticworkers @reshmasaujani @ColleenFlangan advocates for health care and Americans with disabilities—absolutely refusing to be ignored. 
If Trump wants to make America great again, he should start by buying American steel for his construction projects.
In Europe, nationalists like Hungary’s Viktor Orban are exploiting this challenge to stoke fear and resentment. To defeat them and protect democracy, the EU needs a more comprehensive policy that builds societies that are both secure and welcoming.
Third, help elect secretaries of state around the country who will work to make it easier for people to cast their ballots. @iVoteFund is leading the charge here. 
Happy #EarthDay, and thanks to math and science for all you've given us! March on! 🎉🔬🔭

"America is great because America is good, and if we…lift each other up, instead of tearing each other down, we can be even greater."
Almost every newspaper that has endorsed a presidential candidate in the general election has endorsed Hillary. 
We need a strong national defense, but a president shouldn’t need it next to him in a parade to show his patriotism.
.@alliance4youth, @IndivisibleTeam, and @swingleft set about organizing locally to mobilize young people and win back Congress. I truly don't think we would have won back the House without them.
Donald Trump is unqualified to be Commander-in-Chief. A president doesn’t call our military a “total disaster.” 
In the years since, in country after country, human rights have come to be seen not as a high-minded luxury but as a core national interest. But we have urgent work to do.
It's Election Day! Millions of Americans have cast their votes for Hillary—join them and confirm where you vote: 
The move is a dramatic escalation on the attacks on Obamacare in the courts, even for the Trump administration. Under Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department had argued some parts of the law could stand. Now, all of the law's protections will be at the mercy of conservative judges.
It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia.  
Isn't it time to have a mom in the Oval Office?

He wrote approvingly of "recent changes to voting laws" that include not just voter ID but also laws that put restrictions on registration and cut back on both early voting days and polling place locations. All these changes are shown to disproportionately affect voters of color.
To everyone in the path of Hurricane Matthew: Stay safe, and know that America is with you.

The Supreme Court has taken on its first abortion case of the Kavanaugh era—choosing to re-visit a law it struck down in 2016 in the Whole Women's Health case. If the Court defies its own precedent, Roe’s protections will be rendered virtually meaningless. 
The president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the country for a period of crisis. Don't fall for it. Don't let your friends and family fall for it.
They're from America, and you're right about one thing: Currently their government is a complete and total catastrophe. 
My thoughts are with the people of Oman as they mourn the passing of Sultan Qaboos. He led his country with wisdom and provided safe harbor for diplomacy. I’ll always be grateful for all he did to help secure the release from Iran of three American hikers in 2011.

Bill and I will be in Vancouver tonight with @SophiaBush! Sophia's an amazing storyteller, activist and—as she'll tell you—most importantly, she's a voter. 
So in these surreal times, let’s rally together &amp; take action.  Call your House and Senate members at 202-224-3121 and tell them to take care of kids now and protect our seniors, the poor &amp; vulnerable from future attacks. Tell them that it’s the very least they can do.
Not only that - this administration built on their "zero tolerance" policy earlier this month. The result? Nearly 700 more kids were separated from their families in the first two weeks of the new program. Think about that. Hundreds of families torn apart in two weeks.
Sometimes it’s hard to know what to do after a loss. Not this time. This tax bill is only going to get worse as people learn more about it. There are 6 GOP Senators that have to run on it &amp; 2 open seats in 2018.  We all need to get to work.
Last Tuesday, Americans voted a wave of amazing Democrats into office up and down the ballot, including, for the first time, over 100 women in Congress. This Tuesday, ask someone amazing you know to join them in running for office:

If you have any junior-year college students in your life, make sure they know about Organizing Corps—an eight-week paid training program for young people who want to help Democrats win in 2020. The deadline to apply is April 8: 
Over 500 children are still waiting to be reunited with their parents, five weeks after the administration's deadline to reunify families. Every day they are made to wait is a tragedy.
Admitting that can be gutsy in itself! Lovely talking to you. 
Trump appears to have broken the law and acted against our nation's interest, all so he could line his own pockets.  
Victory for Macron, for France, the EU, &amp; the world. Defeat to those interfering w/democracy. (But the media says I can't talk about that)
“Hope is what drives Hillary...it is why she has spent her life fighting for kids who need a champion.” —@FLOTUS 
Where does Trump get his talking points from? Often this alt-right conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones. (Watch all the way to the end.) 
Matthew Shepard's ashes were laid to rest in the Washington National Cathedral today. Two days later, we’ll mark the nine-year anniversary of President Obama signing a law that bears Matthew’s name.
Well, now we know. 
This is one of the best things about Americans—we’re doers. When we see something that needs fixing, we roll up our sleeves and get to work.
The attack on Title X is not isolated. It’s clear that politicians who oppose reproductive health care are coming not just for abortion access, but all reproductive health care. It's up to all of us to fight back. #ProtectX 
“The work of democracy is about trying to do together what we cannot do individually. And so for me the best way to escape my disintegrating body is to engage in this collective struggle.” @AdyBarkan is fighting for health care as a human right: 
This is a big deal: at a time Americans already have reason to be concerned about access to clean drinking water, the president is reportedly planning to repeal major protections preventing lakes and streams from being contaminated by pollutants.
97 years of a passionate, independent spirit, &amp; a fierce commitment to Democratic values. Mary Louise Hancock will be missed by many, including me.
“My son had his whole life to live and he was only six,” said Alberto Romero. His son, Steven, was one of three people killed in yesterday’s shooting at a garlic festival in Gilroy, California. America cannot go on like this. For the sake of our kids, we have to change.

"The men in my life do not talk about women like this, and I know that my family is not unusual.” —@FLOTUS
It was such a delight to talk with the @BGTX team tonight. They’re turning Texas into a battleground state by treating it like one, from endorsing an all-women slate of candidates to registering 55,000 voters this cycle. Hard work pays off. Keep it going—eight more days! #GameOn

But we won't just vote against radicalism, bigotry, and corruption today. We'll vote for fantastic candidates all over the country—including a historic number of women—who want to raise wages, fight for justice, and help more people get health care.
“Should adults be arrested without their children because they are at school, day care, summer camp or a friend’s house, it is possible parents could be deported while their children are left behind.” Who could wish this on another human being?

The test of any society is how it treats its children. We cannot allow millions of kids to lose access to basic health care. 5/7
I just love this: @MMLaFleur and @UniversalStand are offering wardrobe help to women running for any elected office. Affording professional clothing shouldn't be a barrier to better representation of women in public office.

Republican lawmakers justify such laws because they protect against "voter fraud." But "voter fraud" has been proven in study after study to be a virtually non-existent problem, with incidence rates between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent.

Replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh would swing the Court to a new, hard-right majority that would rule against curbing greenhouse gases for years—maybe decades—that we can’t afford to waste on inaction.

We had our first annual @OnwardTogether members call yesterday. Thank you to the thousands of members who joined. We had a chance to hear from a few of our partner groups about the progress they're making to strengthen our democracy. I want to share some of it with you.
I had a lot of fun talking theatre with @jamiedumont, @StageLeft_NYC, and @SimardJennifer for the @fabulousinvalid podcast. You'll never guess what musicals I did in school. (Not a singer.) 
Barack Obama’s greatest strength? “Probably that I’m always early.”  
"You have a chance to reject the politics of fear. You can lift up again the politics of hope.” —@POTUS 
Whatever you do, do something. These midterm elections are our last chance to defend our democracy. Let's win.
Ryan, who was born with a disability and with the support of his family and world-class health care has had a lifetime of opportunities. 
"Let’s go out and prove that love trumps hate!” —Hillary  
This is a disgrace. American citizens need America’s resources. Now.
I’m thrilled to be joining forces with Steven Spielberg to bring @efweiss5’s book “The Woman’s Hour” to TV. It’s about the women who fought for suffrage nearly 100 years ago. We stand on their shoulders, and I’m delighted to have a hand in helping to tell their stories.
The decision we make in four days will affect our country for decades.  this if you agree: 
Every time things aren’t going his way, Donald Trump says it’s “rigged.” #DebateNight 
“She’s just out there every day doing God’s work in her own way. You know? Making her parents proud.” —Betsy, Hillary's lifelong friend 
There is no more important test of our country than the way we treat the most vulnerable among us, especially children. We cannot turn away from what’s happening on our watch - we have to act.
.@dreambignv, one of @OnwardTogether's grantee organizations, is raising money to cover DACA renewal fees for eligible young people across Nevada. If you can, help make sure no DACA recipient has to choose between their family, future, or education: 
A state legislator once brushed off Cassandra Levesque’s campaign to end child marriage in New Hampshire as “a request from a minor doing a Girl Scout project.” So Cassandra, 19 years old, ran for the state legislature herself—and won.  
This is the right thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world. What say you, @Facebook? 
Saddened by the passing of Choco Meza, a historic figure in Texas politics &amp; beloved friend on our team. My prayers are with her family. -H 
Four months old. 
Do your part to hold Donald Trump to the truth. Follow @TheBriefing2016 during tonight's debate for live fact-checking. #Debates
Please do not take medical advice from a man who looked directly at a solar eclipse.
In Michigan, voters chose Democrats to be governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. Since then, the Republican-controlled legislature has passed bills to gut minimum wage, slash paid sick leave, and limit the new secretary of state's powers. 
It's been four minutes. Donald Trump could have launched a nuclear weapon by now. #DebateNight 
I’m so proud of @dougblandry for bringing together 1,800 people from across the country this weekend to learn how to perform one of the most important functions on campaigns: advance work for events. If you’re interested in learning more, sign up at  
"It is great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here. It’s a shame he’s not speaking tonight. I’m curious to hear what a billionaire has to say."

Targeting police officers with violence is unacceptable. My heart breaks for the loss these families have suffered. -H 
Republican officials across the country have used gerrymandering to choose their voters rather than letting voters choose their representatives. Join @DemRedistrict, an @OnwardTogether grantee, to end map manipulation: 
Trump obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell—an accomplished actor. He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight—when she was pregnant. Pathetic.
Actions have consequences, and whether we’re in Syria or not, the people who want to harm us are there &amp; at war. Isolationism is weakness. Empowering ISIS is dangerous. Playing into Russia &amp; Iran’s hands is foolish. This President is putting our national security at grave risk.
This has to be our mission together—doing everything we can to help all our kids, and every American, live up to their God-given potential.
My thoughts are with these families and with everyone who is working to reunite them. Special thanks to Paco, Jaime, Juan, Vanessa, and Pamela, DACA recipients who are working hard at reunification sites to help these families get to their next destinations.
If you could use some counterprogramming to nearly everything in the news right now, may I suggest a book about more than 100 inspiring and courageous women who have changed the country and the world for the better? #gutsywomen 
Hillary and @KingJames are live in Cleveland with two days to go. Watch here: 
The message that women’s rights are human rights was censored on Chinese radio and television in 1995, but it reached the open web. #Web30 #ForTheWeb 
"We’re going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote.” —Hillary 
Millions of Americans will put tax checks in the mail today. Meanwhile, the secretary of the treasury and head of the IRS continue to refuse to turn over Trump's tax returns to Congress for reasons even they can't clearly articulate. #TaxDay
We've already seen the heartbreaking damage that detention can do to kids. It's terrible to think of what could happen to them if they're held indefinitely. You can help by leaving a comment to protest the proposed rule here: 
Pay attention to these voter purges—voter suppression tactics from Republican elected officials—and double-check your registration: 
What’s happening to families at the border right now is a humanitarian crisis. Every parent who has ever held a child in their arms, every human being with a sense of compassion and decency, should be outraged.
For the past two years, we've watched this administration attack and undermine our democratic institutions and values. Today, we say enough.
“In difficult times, we don’t discard our highest ideals, we rise up to meet them.” —@FLOTUS
A little over 15 years ago a bright young woman walked into my office in the Senate and I hired her to be my scheduler. Yesterday @LValmoro was asked back to her alma mater to introduce me to stage. A proud moment for a grateful boss. 
"If you believe that racism and sexism and bigotry have no place in our country...you need to vote." 
@PhilippeReines @RWPUSA @ErinBurnett @CNN 🙏
"Hillary will be a president our kids can look up to." —@FLOTUS 
Yes, we have to win back the presidency in 2020. But local races are just as crucial. Read this thread from the co-founder of @runforsomething, an @onwardtogether partner: 
Over 300 leading scientists from both inside and outside the government worked on the Fourth National Climate Assessment. You can read it in full here. 
This has gone on too long. There is nothing to debate. He must resign. 
A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. 
Thank you, @LIRSorg, for your tireless work to help reunified families rebuild their lives. Everyone can be a part of these efforts—here’s one way to share your support. 
We should be a better country than one that tears families apart, turns a blind eye to women fleeing domestic violence, and treats frightened children as a means to a political end.
Thank you to all who have worn our country's uniform, and the families who serve with them. Happy Veterans Day.
About to take the stage at the AFT Convention in Pittsburgh. Tune in! 
High school and college students of voting age are making a plan to march to the polls together next Tuesday. Make sure young voters you know don't miss out:  
Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons. Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.
Adding a citizenship question to the Census would undoubtedly lead Latino and other residents to avoid responding. The resulting count would be inaccurate, unfair, and unrepresentative—a failure of democracy with real consequences for states and communities.
“The measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls.” —@FLOTUS 
More people will early vote in 2016 than ever before. Join them:  
"My son was Captain Humayun Khan. He was 27 years old. And he was a Muslim American." 
In Puerto Rico for CGI’s 5th Action Network meeting with @BillClinton. Kicked off the week by going to see @Lin_Manuel &amp; the incredible cast of Hamilton perform to benefit the hurricane recovery efforts.We. Had. The. Best. Time. 
One adviser called Hillary's efforts to get kids health insurance a "one-woman army inside the White House." 
Two realities we must confront: 1. Climate change won't just affect the coasts. 2. Climate change is a national security issue. 
We have many fights ahead—from reuniting separated families to making sure the workers who care for families and homes across the country are treated with dignity and respect. I hope you’ll take a moment to learn more about NDWA and their mission: 
We are better than bigotry, fear, and hate.Share this if you agree.  
"Some staff members cried when they learned of the move, the shelter worker said, fearing what was in store for the children who had been in their care." This is horrifying.

“Join me in voting for a better America.” —HillaryRT so your friends can make a plan to vote today: 
Before sending anyone back to their jobs, @realdonaldtrump, you should try doing yours. 
There are only 77 days until the midterms. Are you registered and ready to vote? 
There are many organizations doing great work in the states, but I'd like to highlight three in particular—including two @OnwardTogether partners, @Sister_District and @Flippable_org:
“We need to show each other more kindness and support. The last thing we need in our country is more bullies.” —Hillary
Let's be clear: This administration's dehumanization and cruelty toward migrants will not stop after Kirstjen Nielsen leaves office. It is their principal policy.
“Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life.” —@FLOTUS
"This guy is temperamentally unfit to be Commander-in-Chief and he’s not equipped to be president.” —@POTUS on Trump in North Carolina
Giving a great 4th of July holiday read to a great author &amp; friend, Louise Penny!

Don’t let anyone make you feel alone. We are with you and Puerto Rico. 
Bill and I are sending our condolences today to the family of Richard Hanna, who just passed away from cancer. He knew that we don’t have to see eye to eye on everything to agree that truth matters and right matters in the United States of America. 
Hillary is in Las Vegas, just 6 days from Election Day. Tune in to watch her live:

Just last year, Kavanaugh ruled that the EPA's attempt to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a particularly dangerous greenhouse gas found in refrigeration and air conditioning units, was outside its authority.
"She did everything to make me feel like...I belonged in the White House. Can you imagine? From foster care to the White House." —Shane 
The president hasn't just refused to condemn a foreign power that attacked our democracy. He's also failed to protect the country's voting systems against future attacks. He betrays his oath every day.
Four hundred pieces of legislation have Hillary Clinton's name on them.How many has Donald Trump passed? #debate
Thanks and congratulations to all our @OnwardTogether partners for two years of hard work that paid off in a big way this week.

"Look how far we've come from having no voice to being on the brink of making history." —@Beyonce  
From birth control to cancer screenings, Planned Parenthood has provided care for millions. That's worth celebrating—and protecting. 
Kavanaugh voted in 2012 to uphold a South Carolina voter ID law that the Obama administration found would disenfranchise 80,000 minority voters.
L'Shana Tovah to everyone celebrating Rosh Hashanah! May the coming year be filled with sweetness and joy. -H
"We cannot let anyone take away our hope.We cannot let anyone silence our voices.Because we know that every vote matters."—@FLOTUS
"When it comes to handling a crisis, we’ve seen in this campaign, Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation.” —Hillary
Great move by Chobani. Every parent deserves access to paid family leave. 
One of our most precious rights as Americans is the right to determine who our leaders are. The president abused his powers to cheat in the next election and rob us of that right. Then he obstructed Congress to cover it up. Impeachment is the only remedy. #DefendOurDemocracy
If by "nonsense" you mean "a cruel and absurd plan that will never happen," we agree. #VPDebate 
Make another suit. 
Outrageous: More than 900 children have been separated at the border from their parents since a judge ordered the administration to stop family separations. 
So think of a woman you know who should run for office. Then take a moment today to ask her to do it. Tell her she'll have help from @emergeamerica, @emilyslist, @runforsomething, and you. With one question, you could start something pretty big.
A rally fit for a King.

My thoughts are with everyone affected by record-breaking river flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, particularly hard-hit Nebraska. Nine million people in 14 states are under flood warnings that could persist for weeks. 
Trump has gotten one thing right about the economy. #debate 
Millions of people have lost their employer-tied health care over the last two weeks because of the pandemic. It's an easy call: Re-open the health care exchanges. 
Thank you, @CecileRichards, for your tireless advocacy on behalf of women and girls, and for your grace under pressure over these last 12 years. And thank you to @PPFA for all you’ve done and continue to do to advance reproductive rights. Onward!
He may not remember, but I’ll never forget that day or the years after working as Senator to keep NY safe and helping our First Responders. 
"Can I just say, I am really into electing Hillary Clinton.” —@POTUS:  
We're on track to having the biggest voter turnout in American history.Be a part of it and make a plan to vote: 
This year, @OnwardTogether was able to give more than $2.5 million in funding and grants to organizations fighting to make our country a better place. I'm deeply inspired by what our partners have achieved this year. I think you will be too, so here's a report-back:
In the 1970s, Trump's real estate company marked rental applications for African Americans with a "C" for "colored." 
Donald Trump has a unique view of the Bill of Rights. Here’s what it might look like under his presidency: 
Scrolling through images of the #womensmarch is awe-inspiring. Hope it brought joy to others as it did to me.
When you wake up Wednesday morning, will you know that you've done all you could have? There's still time to:- Talk to friends in swing districts:  Make calls or texts:  Knock on doors near you:

Great to see ppl take to the streets &amp; combat climate change, protect the next generation &amp; fight for jobs &amp; economic justice.#climatemarch
In the year since the March For Our Lives, the House has passed a historic bill that would require background checks on all gun purchases. Now we need a Senate that will vote on it and a president who will make it reality. 
Voting isn't a privilege. It's a right. And requiring voters to pay off fines and fees to exercise that right is a modern-day poll tax. 
It’s true! I want to join your book club to talk about What Happened &amp; what’s happening...sign up! 
@Astrid_NV @iammarleydias @aijenpoo @domesticworkers @reshmasaujani The US women’s hockey and soccer teams stood up for themselves and all women in sports by demanding pay equity and fair treatment.

A mother who lost a son to gun violence asked Hillary a question about how we can stop it: 
What kind of a person brags on 9/11 that, now that the Twin Towers had fallen, a building he owned was the tallest in Lower Manhattan?
Thanks to everyone at @GWRodham for a great discussion last week, and for advocating for stronger communities with better health outcomes.

"He lost $1 billion running a casino. Who does that?” —Hillary on Trump: 
This hasn't gotten enough attn: For the first time, Congress missed the deadline to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. 1/7
This was such a joy. And it's true, we need young people more than ever in public service. There’s a lot of hard work that has to be done, but there’s also a lot of room for imagination. 
Nope.The @ClintonFdn has—among many other things—provided 13k doses of naloxone to fight ODs and helped deliver supplies to Puerto Rico in the face of your inaction.Your foundation, in the NY AG’s words, engaged in “a shocking pattern of illegality.” 
Imagine Donald Trump's most hateful rhetoric signed into law. Mike Pence's record shows that it could happen. 
Today's reason to call your senators and urge them to #StopKavanaugh: Kavanaugh would help kill the Voting Rights Act and uphold voter suppression laws that make it harder for voters of color to cast ballots.
A multimillionaire should never pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse or a policeman or a firefighter.
Oh is that today? 
Second, know that if you're a registered voter, you have the right to vote. This @ACLU guide walks you through your rights. 
We owe it to this young man who lost classmates: 
No child should have to fear violence in their school. It should have been true for Sandy Hook six years ago. It should be true today. Let's keep working until it's reality.
Now is the time to bring human rights out of the ivory tower and into what Eleanor Roosevelt called "small places close to home"—into neighborhoods and schools, offices, factories, and farms, and the hearts and daily interactions of men and women everywhere.
Let’s go make some history today.  
Want to run for office or join a campaign but unsure of how to get started? If you're near Philadelphia, consider attending the @ArenaSummit this weekend. It’s a gathering for the next generation of civic leaders:

Congratulations to Lucy McBath for winning her race for Georgia's sixth congressional district. Lucy entered public life after her son, Jordan, was shot and killed. Now, she's brought her voice to Congress in the fight to prevent gun violence. Onward, Lucy!
Happy Election Day!  
Thank you @CecileRichards for your extraordinary leadership over the last 12 years as president of Planned Parenthood - and for getting up every single day to fight for a world where women's rights truly are human rights. #ThankYouCecile 
In the face of crisis, FDR had the New Deal to help suffering Americans. Now, @realdonaldtrump, you and your fellow Republicans are pushing the #SelfDeal. See the difference?
At tonight's debate, Janelle will be in the audience cheering on her friend, Hillary. #Debate 
As we keep everyone affected by Hurricane Harvey in our thoughts, here’s how you can help:
.@Resist_School has excellent trainings on canvassing best practices, including how to encourage someone to commit to an action (like voting!): 
"To all the women...who put their faith in this campaign and in me...nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion." —Hillary
"They're doing it as we sit here," Director Mueller said of Russian interference. And Republicans are holding open the door, leaving us vulnerable to ongoing attacks. 
Mike Pence has actually signed into law hateful policies like those touted by Donald Trump. 
.@arenasummit, @CollectivePAC, @EmergeAmerica, and @runforsomething have collectively recruited, trained, and supported hundreds of candidates up and down the ballot. They are building a Democratic bench, candidate by candidate and race by race.
Will Ferrell: comedian, actor, just your average millennial. 
A brilliant way to draw attention to the equal pay gap: Women in the UK set out-of-office notifications this weekend saying they'll be out for the final six weeks of the year they'll be working "for free." 
The Trump administration is failing our kids. Vote accordingly.
Trump has made it worse with cruel abuses at the border, detaining children and separating them from their families. It’s one of the most shameful moments in our history.
For forty years, every presidential candidate has released their tax returns—except for Trump. What's he hiding? 
Yes! 
Thinking of those who put their lives on the line to defend America. Let's keep these missing sailors in our thoughts &amp; prayers today. 
We covered the waterfront, give it a listen! 
Thank you for a delightful evening, and please pass along to Jake that a positive review from him goes a long way in our house! 
Going on stage now, watch live! 
“She's got the knowledge and experience and the temperament to be the next Commander-in-Chief.” —@POTUS on Hillary
Americans deserve a real plan to expand access to health care and get costs down.  #debate
I spoke at Oxford University today about the challenges ahead of us, both abroad and at home, and how we can come together to meet them for the sake of our democracy:
It’s been almost 2 months since Congress let the program that provides health care for 9 million children expire. Call Congress &amp; tell them to reauthorize CHIP now: 202-224-3121 
Thanks to @NationalSCLC for the honor of speaking in Atlanta about the fights we need to wage &amp; win now. As we've seen the president use his bully pulpit to pit Americans against one another, we know we are better than this. But we better start proving it and not just saying it. 
So delighted to be at @georgetownsfs today for a de facto State Department reunion with old colleagues and friends, 10 years since I took office as secretary of state. 
16 days.  
Gabby and Mark are right: “America is facing a serious but totally preventable epidemic of gun violence.” Join me in supporting them.

Hillary won tonight. Chip in to help her win on November 8th:  #Debate
Democracy is a habit. It must be practiced again and again. Yes, that means voting. But it also means debating and compromising, participating in shared institutions, and honoring the rights and needs of all citizens.
New York's resilience is stronger than a cowardly act of terror. Thinking of the victims, their families, &amp; the responders who saved lives.
@KLSecondCity Please pass on to Nora that I'm thinking of her, rooting for her, and a proud member of #TeamNora.
While millions of families paid their fair share in taxes, it looks like Trump contributed nothing to our military or our schools for years. 
Historic numbers of people are running for office, and @KChildsGraham's new book captures the inspiration of 35 candidates' stories in one volume—including a foreword from @TammyforIL! As an added bonus, part of the proceeds go to @runforsomething.  
This team has so much to be proud of. Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything. 
Women's reproductive rights are human rights that are universal and indivisible. Governments do not get to pick and choose whose rights and which rights will be respected.
Best of luck to the Member Team &amp; the Press Team tonight at the @CWSoftballGame, which raises money for young women with cancer. #CWSG

I'm so proud of @TerryMcAuliffe for his continued leadership in Virginia. It’s absolutely crucial that we win back state legislatures ahead of next year’s Census and redistricting process, and that’s exactly what he’ll help do in his home state. Thank you for your service, Terry.
If we had a dollar for every time Mike Pence lied last night, well... 
In its 120-year history, @azcentral has never endorsed a Democrat.Here's why the paper just endorsed Hillary: 
Asked why she persisted in the fight for women’s suffrage, ratified August 18, 1920, Alice Paul said: “When you put your hand to the plow, you can’t put it down until you get to the end of the row.” With thanks to our forebears for all they've fought for, the work continues. 
.@SwingLeft has launched a virtual organizing hub so that you can help elect Democrats while still staying home. 
The Central Park Five were exonerated. What does it say about Trump that he thinks they should still be in prison? 
For all of those who can differentiate a #FamiliesFirst package from self-serving slush funds: Call your representatives 202-224-3121 to let them know which one you support. 
The administration's ban on transgender servicemembers begins today. It is abhorrent. Every American should be able to serve their country, and I can't believe we're still debating that in 2019. We have to reverse this as soon as we can.
When it comes to policy plans, there's no comparing Hillary and Trump. #DebateNight 
As I said after the Iran deal was reached, it was not perfect but it achieved its fundamental mission of blocking every pathway for Iran to get a bomb.
The result: 
Can't vote in person? Get an absentee ballot. 
"In this race, we have a candidate whose vision for our country is completely and utterly lacking in hope." —@FLOTUS on Trump
The white nationalists certainly think MAGA is a white nationalist slogan. 
As president Hillary will stand up for kids and families. She’s done it her whole life: 
Let us be clear: The president has sided with authoritarian leaders of Turkey and Russia over our loyal allies and America’s own interests. His decision is a sickening betrayal both of the Kurds and his oath of office.
This election is about whether we’re a country that lifts each other up or tears each other down. 
"We don't want to go back. We want to go forward." —@RepJohnLewis  
When Bronx found out he shares a birthday with Hillary (October 26—today!), he was determined to write her a letter.  
Ryan Ubuntu Olson has worked with governments, businesses, and service organizations to support marginalized communities. 
A four-year college should not be the only path to a middle-class life:

Six weeks after the administration's deadline to reunify families, 497 children are still waiting.
27 million Latinos are eligible to vote this year.Millions have already voted.Ready to join them?  
Ambassador @McFaul is a patriot who has spent his career standing up for America. To see the White House even hesitate to defend a diplomat is deeply troubling. 
In America, we don’t say we’re going to “keep you in suspense” about whether we’ll respect the outcome of an election.
Instead of dark and divisive, our vision for America is hopeful and inclusive. Big-hearted, not small-minded. It’s about lifting people up.
Ryan talks about living with a disability—and befriending Hillary back in 1994: "She looks at me the way I always wanted to be looked at." 
When pressed about Trump insulting and demonizing Latinos and immigrants, Mike Pence had a...telling response. 
I gave @TheEllenShow a little preview of #HillaryonHulu, the four-part docuseries premiering in March. It's the story of my life—but it's also the story of American women over the past 50 years.

Let's talk about Brett Kavanaugh's past rulings on guns. He's out of the mainstream, even among other conservative judges, in his willingness to strike down legislatures' public safety measures to prevent gun violence if they don't align with his politics.
“Two words give us hope: Madam President." —@VogueMagazine  
We make it almost impossible for too many women to balance work and family. That needs to change:

Congratulations to @Marie4Congress for her win in #IL03 yesterday. It's a victory for reproductive rights, better health care, DREAMers, our climate, and an economy that works for everyone.
Next week, Bill and I will be in New York on the 11th with @PaulBegala (expect 2020 talk), Detroit on the 12th with @RedHourBen (expect belly laughs), and Philadelphia on the 13th with Nnamdi Asomugha (expect football &amp; Broadway chatter). Looking forward!

"This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here." —Hillary #AlSmithDinner
This election will have record turnout, because voters see through Trump’s shameful attempts to undermine it just weeks before it happens. 
This is not just about a reckoning with the recent past. This is about what is going on today and threats to our next election, to our defense as a nation. 
“Let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary. Let us not lose heart. For there are more seasons to come and...more work to do.”

This is cruel and utterly unnecessary. This girl must be reunited with her family immediately. 
Now is the time to listen to the students, teachers, and parents demanding that we end this carnage once and for all with gun safety laws that keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn’t have them.
The president has abused his power—using his office to further not the nation's objectives but his own personal, political objectives—and, together, we are holding him accountable. Feel proud. Keep going.
The deadline to make a public comment opposing indefinite detention of immigrant families is the same as another big deadline—November 6. As you GOTV, take five minutes to say #FamiliesBelongTogether: 
"We are Black, we are proud, and here’s why we are working to elect Hillary." @HFA staffers on why they're with her:  
People being held in ICE detention sites are going on hunger strikes to protest conditions. ICE is force-feeding them. None of this should be happening in America. 
With our democracy in crisis and our institutions and traditions under siege, we need to do everything we can to fight back. Here's how.
Americans are coming together to reject hate and division. Americans are rejecting Donald Trump’s demeaning treatment of women.

Bill and I send our warmest congratulations to Meghan, Harry, and the entire @RoyalFamily for the new addition! What a blessing.
There's a lot going on right now—understatement of the year. The separation of families and the failure of the administration to reunite them has been eclipsed in the news in recent days, but these tragic circumstances persist. Here are some of the latest developments:
During the Obama years, Kavanaugh came down against the EPA in every one of the three major cases he heard about the agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

This took courage. Thank you, David, for speaking out. Now let’s turn to the future and mobilize people for the midterms. 
Today there are gubernatorial elections in Louisiana, Kentucky, &amp; Mississippi, state legislative elections in New Jersey and Virginia, &amp; hundreds of local races across the country. Their outcomes could give us fairer district maps and much more. Go vote! 
Of course, combating climate change is about more than dollars and cents. It's a moral imperative. Our children and grandchildren deserve to live on a planet that can support their lives, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

After Justice Kennedy announced his retirement from the Supreme Court, @WeDemandJustice leapt into action to launch a movement to #StopKavanaugh. They're doing a 10-city #RiseUpForRoe tour and will have a day of action on 8/26: 
Donald Trump's equal pay plan for women: "You're gonna make the same if you do as good a job." 
Imagine an America in which women are barred from getting IUDs or birth control pills, and doctors are criminalized for prescribing them. It's an America in which women would be punished for insisting on being full and equal partners in society.
The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.
Thank you all for your service to your country. Take a well-deserved rest, and then let's keep going.
When Trump calls America a "third-world country," you can tell he doesn't do a lot of listening to what's actually happening in America. 
I'm so proud of @OnwardTogether partners &amp; grantees like @ArenaSummit, @IndivisibleTeam, @RunForSomething, @SwingLeft, @VotoLatino, @EmergeAmerica, and more who recruited candidates, mobilized voters, and changed the map for Democrats. And I know you’re just getting started. 💪

A promise to "Make America Great Again" might mean more from someone who actually made his products in America. 
That ruling won't just hurt seven million public-sector union workers with contracts. It'll hurt all workers, because union deals on wages and working conditions affect what businesses without unions do, too.
Today marks one year since the administration announced its "zero tolerance" policy at the border. Families were ripped apart with no plan to reunite them. Many are still waiting. It is a defining failure of policy and humanity.
"You have a candidate who is worthy of your vote—who is smart, who is steady, who is tested.” —@POTUS on Hillary

When people feel they can't run for office because of the intimidation and hatred they'll face as candidates, democracy is in danger. 
This is not in line with American values, and it’s a dangerous path. It's a fundamental building block of democracy that elected representatives respect the outcome of elections. To ignore those outcomes is to silence voters and endanger the health of our democracy itself.

Only about 1% of abortions happen later in pregnancy—almost always because a woman’s health or life is at risk, or the pregnancy is no longer viable. Lying about this is dangerous, and a slap in the face to families who face heartbreaking situations.

Make sure @realDonaldTrump's bullying never reaches the White House. Chip in now:  
I say this as a former Secretary of State and as an American: the Russians are still coming. Our intelligence professionals are imploring Trump to act. Will he continue to ignore &amp; surrender, or protect our country?

Kavanaugh didn't use that term because he misunderstands the basic  science of birth control—the fact that birth control prevents fertilization of eggs in the first place. He used that term because it's a dog whistle to the extreme right.

The rules Sen. McConnell has proposed for the president's impeachment trial are the equivalent of a head juror colluding with the defendant to cover up a crime.Call your senators and urge them to push for witnesses and evidence, not a cover-up: 
President Trump, Sec. Mattis, and DOD should send the Navy, including the USNS Comfort, to Puerto Rico now. These are American citizens. 
With their votes to make the American president accountable to no one, Republican senators have put the interests of one president over the interests of all Americans.The only remedy now is for us all to vote in overwhelming numbers to replace them—and him—in November.

We counted all the times Donald Trump lied in last night’s debate so you didn’t have to. 
"Hillary Clinton fights for us. It is now time for us to fight for Hillary.” —@ElizabethForMA 
“When the middle class thrives, America thrives.” —Hillary in Cleveland 
Congratulations to all the voters, volunteers, organizers, and candidates who voted last night to put a powerful check on this administration and start building a better future for everyone in our country.
"Donald Trump’s closing argument is, ‘What do you have to lose?’The answer is everything.” —@POTUS 
Until Facebook takes responsibility for damaging democracies by letting propaganda run amok, we need to counter the Trump operation where it lives. Glad to see this effort from @davidplouffe and @pacronym. 
“You represent the best of America, and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.” —Hillary to @HFA
An administration's budget says a lot about what—and, more importantly, who—it values. So let's talk about the Trump administration's 2020 budget proposal and why it makes clear that this administration doesn’t value seniors, low-income families, and young people.
I'm with them.
At the #VPDebate, Mike Pence tried really, really hard to deny pretty much everything Donald Trump has said and done. Let's replay the tape: 
Want to fight back against Trump's ridiculous address tonight? Send some support to organizations that help kids at the border. The only border crisis we're facing is the inhumane detention of kids that has already led to the deaths of two children. 
We now know that more than 700 kids were separated from their parents between October 2017 and April 2018. As a mother and a grandmother, it’s devastating to even imagine.
Three candidates that @iVoteFund supported for Secretary of State won—all pick-ups, all young women, all Democrats. And they were able to raise and invest $7 million in Secretary of State races, their most ever.
"It was overwhelming, in every sense of that word." —Betsy, Hillary's oldest friend, on casting the Illinois delegation's votes at the DNC 
"She believes we can summon what’s best in each of us and make this country better for all of us.” —@POTUS on Hillary
"Our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years, but all the time." —Hillary
No family should have to go through this. Please join me in telling @DHS_Wolf that #FamiliesBelongTogether. 
So many groups own a piece of last night's victory, from @theDemocrats to @EMILYsList to @TheDLCC. It's remarkable to watch our Democratic family—groups with decades of victories and those born in the aftermath of the last election—team up to make nights like last night possible.
A week ago, 200,000 previously uninsured Virginians got access to health care through Medicaid expansion thanks to votes from @KathyKLTran, @PWCDanica, @JCarrollFoy, @DelegateFowler, and other 2017 state leg winners. Elections have consequences, and sometimes they're great ones.
Such a pleasure seeing @BetteMidler back where she belongs! Huge thanks to the cast and crew of @HelloDollyBway for a joyful night (I'll never wash this cheek again)! 
On this holy weekend for many faiths, we must stand united against hatred and violence. I'm praying for everyone affected by today's horrific attacks on Easter worshippers and travelers in Sri Lanka.
A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.
Last week, every senator swore to "do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws" in the president's impeachment trial.Last night, Republican senators cast vote after vote to block evidence and testimony.The American people deserve a real trial, not a cover-up.
My thoughts are with everyone affected by this morning’s horrific shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We can and must put a stop to this violence and this hate. It should have no home in America.
"Come January 20, America will have a new president. ... The question is, what kind of change are we going to see?" —Hillary
Jasmine Clark is running to represent District 108 in Georgia's House. A microbiologist, she serves as faculty at universities in the Atlanta area and wants to bring both her scientific background and record of community activism to the state legislature. 
@Hickenlooper @GoldfishSmiles @bhtm And they say you’re moderate.
Some of the most painful and rewarding conversations I have had on the campaign trail were with parents who had lost their children to gun violence.
Love a family of #gutsywomen. Thank you so much for joining us, Michelle and Colleen! 
With a mother in the Oval Office, we may finally catch up to the rest of the world on paid leave. 
Democracy means debating and compromising, participating in shared institutions, and honoring the rights and needs of all citizens. I was honored to share this message at Queen's University Belfast today.  
"I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love.” —Hillary
Most of us learned by elementary school that it’s not OK to insult people’s looks.Donald calls women fat, ugly, and disgusting.
"Even if you’re not for me, I promise, I will be for you as your president.” —Hillary in Arizona
Photos that help remind us that this election is about building a country we can all be proud of—together. 
"If there is a book that you want to read but it hasn't been written yet, you must be the one to write it," Toni Morrison said. We are all so lucky to live in a world where she took her own advice and shared it with others.
Join Hillary live in Detroit just 4 days from Election Day: 
Happy #Pride2017 to everyone in NYC &amp; across the globe. Never forget that LGBT rights are human rights &amp; human rights are LGBT rights. 
I’m sending my prayers to the families and the community affected by last night’s horrific attack on a rabbi’s home in Monsey. We must all stand shoulder to shoulder to fight anti-Semitism and demand that our elected leaders do the same.
FACT: The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to America’s national security.
It's pretty simple: Men and women in the same job should get the same pay. The House has passed the #PaycheckFairnessAct to help make equal pay a reality. It's 2019! Let's get it done. 
Happy birthday, @BillClinton! You can sign his card here:  
"Make no mistake: Women’s health and rights—our futures, the futures of our daughters and granddaughters—are on the ballot.” —Hillary
May we all open our hearts and reach across tables today. May we all find hopes and values in common. May there be pie. Happy Thanksgiving.
.@timkaine just reminded Mike Pence of the bigoted things Trump has said about millions of Americans—and Pence couldn't defend it. #VPDebate
We'll never forget. 
Ayanna Pressley and Jahana Hayes will be the first black women to represent Massachusetts and Connecticut in Congress, respectively. Tish James will be the first black woman to be New York's attorney general.

The honor is ours; it’s not every day you meet a queen. 👑 
Congrats to @IndivisibleTeam volunteers around the country for hosting and running 150+ events this weekend to reach out to voters one conversation at a time. For anyone who's not on the team yet, don't miss out—join here!  
Congratulations to @nellwyn for becoming the new CTO for @TheDemocrats. She's a brilliant technologist and leader, and the first woman ever to hold the position. 
.@IndivisibleTeam @swingleft .@ColorOfChange is organizing for criminal justice reform, voter freedom, fairness and accuracy in media, and other racial justice issues.
For those few people knocking public service, hope you'll reconsider answering the call to help others. Because we're stronger together.
"To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. We thank you for your graceful, determined leadership.”
I’ll be joining @NYGovCuomo as he lays out his plan to codify Roe v. Wade and pass the Reproductive Health Act. There’s no time to wait. #RHAin30Days 
How do you say "gutsy women" in Welsh? Honored to join just a few of them—@Kirsty_Williams, @LauraMcAllister, Dean Elwen Evans, and @AnnaJonesSky—at @SwanseaUni &amp; @Swansea_Law today. You can watch our full conversation here: 
"I want a president who stands up against intolerance."The cast of @EmpireFOX on why they're with Hillary:  
Text JOIN to 47246 and sign up to help us get out the vote. 
Great step forward by the Obama administration. It’s past time for Congress to guarantee paid sick leave for everyone. -H 
May we all stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong as they speak out for democracy, freedom from repression, and a world they long to see.
Trump "finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall.” —Hillary
The progress we’ve made under @POTUS is on the line. We owe it to our kids to get out and vote:  
Georgians have the power on Dec. 4 to help make elections in their state are free and fair again. Make sure your friends and family know to vote for Democrat John Barrow in the run-off to be secretary of state. Polling place and other information here: 
@cirilliang Thank YOU and your colleagues for all you are doing. I'm just one of millions of people who are enormously grateful. Please stay safe and healthy.
Try our new tool! See how much you'd pay in federal income taxes if you paid the same as "billionaire" Donald Trump: 
For many campaigns, @SwingLeft was the wave. On average, for their top 15 campaigns, Swing Left drove more than 50% of their canvassing shifts. More than 60,000 volunteers knocked an estimated 5 million doors and made 2.5 million phone calls.
Here we go again. The Trump Admin is trying to take away your health care by ending protections for ppl w/ pre-existing conditions. It will hurt millions of Americans. Spread the word. Call your Congress member &amp; tell them to stand up for you: 202-224-
We can't let Donald Trump bully his way to the presidency. 
"To Bill, Chelsea, Marc, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers, and our entire family—my love for you means more than I can ever express." —Hillary
Another urgent reason to take on climate change: Its impact on human health, especially the health of children. 
The next president should sweat the details on policy—because it's not just a detail when it's your child. 
“We’re going to work our hearts out to make Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States.” —@ElizabethForMA 
An inspiring number of first-time candidates ran and won office in 2018, and organizations like @TrainDems were instrumental to those victories. Over 21,000 candidates and activists have signed up for the NDTC’s trainings, and they’re just getting started. 
This is an awful story: A DACA recipient in good standing was told by her airline she could work on a route to Mexico. Now she's in detention and ICE is threatening to revoke her status. Please sign and get the word out: 
Purging public servants disloyal to a regime is banana-republic stuff. Our federal employees work for the American people, not the president. 
"Hillary Clinton is far better than Trump or anyone else running. She should be president." —@PhillyDotCom 
Donald Trump actually stood on a debate stage and said wages in America are too high.
Here's what I'm listening to today. Hope you'll tune in too: 
A great opportunity for young people in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin: Gain in-the-field organizing experience this summer for 2020 and beyond with Organizing Corps. 
U.S. intelligence has confirmed the Russian government is directing cyberattacks against the U.S. to influence the outcome of our election.
Can we just stop and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe? Who would act like this? A bully.
More than 200 major corporations, 500 statewide and local organizations, a bipartisan consensus in Congress, and 70% of Americans support legislation protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination. I am proud to stand with them and the other @HRC to support the #EqualityAct.
This heartbreaking video from the ACLU shows the consequences of separation: 
"We’re going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families making less than $125,000 a year.” 
The government shutdown is by far the longest in U.S. history. It's put hundreds of thousands of people under financial stress and endangered our security. Join a National Call In Day to end it. @IndivisibleTeam has scripts and numbers for senators here: 
Alex Brown is running for a seat on Chico, California's city council. She has worked in social services for most of her career and is particularly passionate about mental health, LGBTQ+ advocacy, and violence prevention. 
You don't want to miss this. Join Hillary and @FLOTUS on the trail together for the first time in NC → 
At the debate, the impeccably dressed Ken Bone asked a great question about meeting our energy needs. Hillary’s response: 
If you already have student debt, we’ll help you refinance and pay it back as a percentage of your income. 
One day left to apply to #ArenaAcademy with @OnwardTogether partner @arenasummit. They’ll train you to staff a North Carolina state legislative race and hit the ground running to win this fall. All experience levels welcome. 
It takes courage to exercise your right to protest injustice, especially when you’re 11!  Keep up the good work Mariana. 
Give them all a follow, a RT, or an email sign-up—you won't regret it. You can also sign up for updates from Onward Together here: 
Delighted that @NYGovCuomo proposed free college for ppl making &lt;125K in NY. A plan @SenSanders &amp; I worked hard on. 
"If she gets to be president, she won’t waste a day." —@BillClinton, now playing on With Her at  
Lucy, you took your unspeakable tragedy and helped propel an inspiring movement for gun safety in America. Thank you for your leadership on this and so much more. 
"More than 10 million people have already voted in this election—and two million of them are right here in Florida.” 
Parkland students, you have shown so much courage in standing up for truth, for your right to attend school safely, &amp; now against these disgusting smears. The good news is, it will only make you louder &amp; stronger. 
“Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.” —Hillary
"The policies of this administration have driven this economy into a ditch.” —PenceNope. #VPDebate 
Mocking a disabled reporter. Attacking a Gold Star family. Insulting a judge. Trump has never apologized—because that's just who Trump is.
Scripture tells us: Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart. 
Forever proud of @chefjoseandres and the way he models service and community in times of crisis. 
Check out our new tool: Every time @realDonaldTrump tweets something offensive, automatically donate. 
A terrible truth: Not everyone who is eligible to vote in America has free and fair access to the ballot box. Hear @EricHolder, @AriBerman, @AndrewGillum, &amp; @MariaTeresa1 lay out how we can defend voting rights:  #DefenseOfDemocracy
Now that's pretty rich coming from a guy who paid $0 in taxes for 18 years:  
"My view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead.” —Hillary in Florida
We can’t do any of these things without your help.Our future is on the ballot.Let's prove that #LoveTrumpsHate: 
In light of clear evidence that Russia has interfered with our elections in the past and seeks to do so again, it's inexcusable that the administration is downsizing DHS task forces charged with protecting our elections from foreign influence. 
"It’s amazing that I’m up here after Donald. I didn’t think he’d be OK with a peaceful transition of power." —Hillary at the #AlSmithDinner
You can go to  right now to make sure you’re registered to vote.
RT this if you think kids and families deserve a champion in the White House.  
There's something all of us can do to be braver, more resilient, kinder, and more grateful. This holiday season, that’s my wish for all of us. Happy New Year!
The theme of the night: "I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend...Donald Trump." —@timkaine #VPDebate 
The president believes he is above the law. The president is wrong. 
There was a 10-point increase in youth turnout from 2014 to 2018, due in part to the hard work done by @Alliance4Youth. More than 30% of young people voted in 2018! In Chicago, young people outperformed all other generations on Election Day for the first time ever.
Show Trump his tweets come at a cost—because Hillary supporters are pledging to donate every time he tweets:  
Computer scientists have apparently uncovered a covert server linking the Trump Organization to a Russian-based bank. 
The astronomical cost of insulin is a public health crisis. 
No time to waste - we've got to fight with everything we've got to #DefendDACA. Thanks, @jorgeramosnews, for sharing these powerful stories. 
If you believe that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote.  
A reminder of why the 2018 midterms were so important: Tens of thousands of people now have health care in Maine because Gov. Mills fulfilled the will of voters and expanded Medicaid. 
"With Donald, it’s always Donald Trump first and everyone else last.” —Hillary
Tonight, @cvivianstringer won her 1,000th career victory as a basketball coach. She's just the ninth coach in the history of the sport to reach this milestone, the fifth NCAA Division 1 women's coach and the first African American. Congrats, Coach Stringer, and here’s to 1,001. 
This thread has important information for Texans about using the state's electronic voting machines. Casting your ballot should be easy. If it isn't, call the 866-OUR-VOTE Election Protection hotline. 
Pantsuit up.  
If you believe all our kids should have good schools and good teachers, no matter what ZIP code they live in, then you have to vote. 
.@LeahGreenB and @EzraLevin are former congressional staffers who started a Google Doc for citizens who wanted to have more of a voice in their government. It became @IndivisibleTeam—a grassroots network of advocates around the country. 
I don't know who needs to hear this, but the president is not above the law.
“Let’s make history!” —Hillary 
A reported 211 families are still waiting to be reunited since the administration separated them at the border. It's been a full eight weeks since the deadline to reunite them, and we all need to continue speaking out about this inexcusable delay. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Join us at 7:30 ET tonight! 
A second call you can make right now to help families who want to reunite with their kids: Call your member of Congress and ask them to put pressure on CBP to grant asylum to parents applying in Mexicali today. The Capitol switchboard number is 202-224-3121.

We couldn't be more lucky to have someone with Anne's talent and experience out on the campaign trail. 
Share this if you're voting today for National Early Vote Day!  
This week's congressional recess is a great opportunity to talk to your representatives face to face about why they should support automatic voter registration, nationwide early voting, and other fixes to our democracy. Find a town hall near you: 
I happened to be booked on @TheEllenShow the day of Trump's impeachment vote. Here were my thoughts. 
Yesterday, Khizr Khan told the story of a 10-year-old boy who was bullied at school—until his class watched Mr. Khan's speech. 
"In the quiet moments backstage or at the end of a long day, I find myself thinking about my mother."  
I also want to shout out @Hashmi4Va, the first Muslim woman elected to the VA State Senate. As she said yesterday, her victory "belongs to all of you who believed that we needed to make progressive change here in Virginia, for all of you who felt that you haven’t had a voice."
During his testimony about Trump’s crimes, Lt. Col. Vindman had a message for his father: "You made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth." It’s appalling that this administration may prove him wrong. 
Grateful to you and your determined husband. Like I say in my book, I would have worked so hard to help, &amp; had specific ideas to do just that. 
"Latinas still make 55 cents for every dollar a white man makes. That’s just totally unacceptable." —Hillary 
Love to see gutsy women flocking together. @GretaThunberg @Malala 
A seven-hour wait to vote is a poll tax. We need to restore the Voting Rights Act and stop Republican elected officials from shutting down polling sites. 
Election Day is almost over. Don’t wait—go vote now! Confirm where you vote at  
RT this if you're proud to have Hillary's back tonight.  
“There’s something really exciting happening right now—people are coming together…to reject hate and division.” —Hillary
They're voting. Are you? Make sure you're registered:  
I'm in but only if I can be power forward. 
Implicit bias is real. It hurts Americans. Anyone who'd outright deny its existence is unfit for the White House. #VPDebate
"Don’t fall for the easy cynicism that your vote doesn’t matter…that’s what Hillary's opponent wants you to think.” —@POTUS
"We have got to be as clear as possible: You are more than the way you look.” —Hillary to young girls 
As we hold Paris in our thoughts today, let’s also send some love to our neighbors in Louisiana. Three historically black churches have burned in recent weeks, charring buildings and scattering communities. If you can, contribute to rebuilding funds here: 
We should all bear witness to the humanitarian crisis at our border and continue to work to stop it. "Thousands of children are living in a tent prison. In the desert. For months on end." 
How many ways can this administration show us they don’t care about kids? Another example of rejecting science &amp; putting corporate interests before babies. These are the stories that will get lost in the shuffle &amp; do lasting damage to people everywhere.
Only one candidate in this election has actual plans to help middle-class families:  
It should concern every American that Russia is willing to engage in such hostile acts in order to help Donald Trump become president. 
With just 10 days until Election Day, Hillary’s on the trail in Florida.Watch live: 
The administration is deporting people back to slavery:
"We urge voters to dump Trump and choose the clearly qualified candidate in this race: Hillary Clinton” —@DenverPost 
Every single Senate Democrat has signed on as a co-sponsor of the #ForThePeople Act to fix our broken democracy. Have Republican senators? Give them a call today and tell them you want automatic voter registration, early voting, and less money in politics: (202) 224-3121
Our vision for America is a country where everyone has a place, including, of course, Muslim Americans. #Debate 
Don't let this man become your next president:  
A new book is out today that picks up where I left off in What Happened in explaining “Those Damn Emails.” Terrific, fact-filled read.
Congratulations to all the organizers and volunteers who have worked so hard to get out the vote in Iowa. Today is the day! Fighting for what you believe in is always, always worth it.
Looking forward to honoring some brave young people tonight at @ChildDefender where I started my career. Tune in:  -H

@emilyslist Today, @emilyslist announced that 15,000+ women have reached out since Election Day about running for office! 7,000+ want to help them run.
@realDonaldTrump If you didn't like that book, try this one — some good lessons in here about working together to solve problems. Happy to send a copy. 
No family should spend more than 10% of its income on child care.Here's how we can achieve that goal:

We shouldn't have had to wait until 2019 for this first, but I'm glad we're here. Go, @AudreyGelman, go! 
“He and his family exemplify the values that make America great.” —Hillary on Khizr Khan 
Just 17 days left in this campaign. If you're proud to stand with Hillary, chip in now and get your free sticker: 
A wonderful development of this election: Americans elected more than 600 LGBTQ candidates across the country. @victoryinst trained 60 of them. With just 0.1% of elected positions held by LGBTQ people, it has ambitions to build an even bigger #RainbowWave: 
My friend Amo Houghton, who passed away last week, would not want much fuss to be made about him. He would want all of us to take care of our communities, stand our ground, and find common ground. 
If you’re like me, there’s nothing worse than feeling helpless. So on this National Day of Action for Children (supported by groups from @ACLU to @WomenBelong to @UnitedWeDream to @MomsRising, @DomesticWorkers), visit  to see what you can do to help.
It's wonderful to see @LeahGreenB and @EzraLevin recognized for their contributions through @IndivisibleTeam, one of our @OnwardTogether partners. As @AyannaPressley says, they are "a constant source for good." #TIME100

"Even in the middle of crisis, she is calm and cool and collected.” —@POTUS on Hillary
This sickening horror is one man’s fault. 
His last campaign manager, Anne Kronenberg, said of Harvey Milk: "He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us." No better legacy. #HarveyMilkDay
Tyrone Gayle, a beloved member of the HFA team, was known to stay at the office until midnight and run six miles the next morning. Now, his friend (and fellow HFA alum) Jesse is running to raise funds for Tyrone as he fights cancer. Pitch in if you can: 
Want to be inspired? Watch this remarkable ad before you go out and vote. 
There is a federal law banning FGM. It is the Department of Justice’s responsibility to defend it. They’re choosing instead to abandon the fight for the health and human rights of women and girls around the world. If you agree that’s outrageous, let them know: 202-353-1555 
We face a serious choice on Tuesday: Will we act to protect the planet for our kids and grandkids, or do nothing?  
Our democracy is broken. House Democrats' first bill, #HR1, would help fix it. Call your representative now and ask them to support automatic voter registration, restoring the Voting Rights Act, and lessening the influence of big money in politics: 
Thirty-five days until the election. Have your friends and family checked their voter registration yet? Give them a nudge to do it today. Deadlines are approaching quickly. 
On this #TransDayOfVisibility, let's affirm that we see, stand by, and celebrate our transgender friends, family, and neighbors. 
We've raised over $100k and counting for organizations that help families and kids at the border since the beginning of the president's TV stunt last night. Let's keep counteracting his lies about migrants and refugees with positive action:  
Let’s not be distracted. Let’s continue to stand up, organize, resist, put forth good ideas to improve the existing system &amp; peoples' lives.
America is better than Donald Trump.  
"We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to...make their own decision about pregnancy." —@timkaine

Trump’s campaign is bragging that not paying taxes makes him a “genius.” 
Two years ago in Charlottesville, a neo-Nazi drove a car into a crowd of people protesting white supremacy and killed Heather Heyer. May we honor her memory by speaking out against hatred, as she did, and working together to defeat it.
On this International Day of the Girl, I’m thinking about all the gutsy girls who are changing the world—@GretaThunberg, @Emma4Change, @NaomiWadler, and @Malala, just to name a few—and all those who will. #DayOfTheGirl #GutsyWomen
On the same day:- Two prosecutors have resigned from the DOJ to protest the administration’s intervention to lighten the sentence of one of Trump’s accomplices- The Senate GOP blocked votes on three bills to secure our electionsThe rule of law &amp; our democracy are in crisis.
“Elections have consequences. Your vote counts. Your vote has consequences.” —@AlGore 
Bill and I are about to go on stage in Michigan with @RedHourBen—I’m not sure what we’ll talk about, I just know I'm looking forward to it. See you soon, Detroit.
“I am grateful to our country for all it has given me. I count my blessings every day that I am an American.” —Hillary
8 things you should know about @TimKaine before tonight's debate.  #VPDebate
Trump "can run his campaign however he chooses...I’m going to keep talking about the stakes in this election.” 
I'm thrilled today to endorse 19 @runforsomething candidates. These thoughtful young people are committed to serving their communities and they'll bring fresh perspectives and new solutions to public office. I can't wait to see what they accomplish. 
Here in America, we are taught to and we should respect each other, lift each other up, and celebrate our diversity.
.@VotoLatino registered thousands of voters through online digital ads and targeting, peer-to-peer outreach through their local chapters, and national partner engagement. In Texas, where Voto Latino has had a program since 2010, early votes surpassed 2014 totals by 149%.
Kavanaugh has consistently argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has limited authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon and other pollutants that are causing the planet to heat up.
When you're 27 million strong, no one can tell you that you don't belong.  
Chip in to help make sure Donald Trump never becomes president:  
Today we remember Hadiya, &amp; all victims of gun violence. Proud of these young dynamos &amp; all those committed to the cause. #WearOrangeDay 
"Let’s work our hearts out so we can finally say 'Madam President.’” —@MachadoOficial  
World Series champs should get statehood. #FinishTheFight
"Hillary is running on the message of hope and unity that we need." —@KingJames 
When Hillary learned that the families of the fallen were only promised $12,000 in benefits, she took action. 
There are a lot of reasons to vote against Donald Trump. Maybe, for you, it’s his dangerous statements about using nuclear weapons. 
When Trump and Pence attack Planned Parenthood, they're attacking millions of Americans. 
This is an incredibly useful new tool from @OnwardTogether partner @SwingLeft: Enter your zip code to find what you can do to help Democrats win the most important elections, no matter where you live. 
Hillary’s speaking in Florida on her plan to expand opportunities for national service. Watch here: 
"Hillary and I have lost a true and treasured friend." —@BillClinton and Hillary on the passing of Shimon Peres 
Trump "doesn't have the temperament or the judgment...or the basic honesty that a president needs to have" —@POTUS: 
"Take it from me, your vote can make all the difference in this election.” —@AlGoreText CLIMATE to 47246 to make sure you're registered.
While Donald Trump is assaulting our democracy, millions of people are standing up for it—registering, voting early, and volunteering.
3-0
"With the election just 8 days away...Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates."
A Mother of the Movement to prevent gun violence, @SybrinaFulton has already helped turn tragedy into action. Now she’s running for office as a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, District 1. If you can, contribute to help her win and make the change we need: 
Couldn't be prouder of @TimKaine. Pitch in $5 now to make sure he becomes our next vice president:  #VPDebate
"Tomorrow, with your vote, you can say that this country has always been great, that it is the greatest nation on earth.” —@FLOTUS
"If we keep at it the way Hillary has kept at it decade after decade, progress happens." —@POTUS 
As we finalize our plans for 2019 and beyond, I'm feeling grateful and proud to work alongside these smart, passionate partners. As ever, you can learn more about our work and help support it at  Onward to 2019.
"I truly believe that you deserve a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against.” —Hillary 
A piece of good news for reproductive rights: A judge has blocked the administration’s Title X gag rule. “At the heart of these rules is an arrogant assumption that the government is better suited to direct women’s healthcare than their providers.” Indeed. 
Now is the time for leaders to be strong in their words &amp; deliberate in their actions.
Everything we’ve worked toward comes down to today. RT this if you're voting for Hillary:  
"Hillary has comprehensive policies to help people. Her opponent has tweets.You decide.” —@FLOTUS
“In these final weeks of the election season, find someone to tell about Clinton’s lifetime of service.”—@wigazette 
When a gun is present in a domestic violence situation, the risk of the woman getting murdered rises by 500 percent. Tell your senators to stand up to the NRA, close the "boyfriend loophole," and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. 
Nevada just became the first state in the country to have a legislature that's majority women. Let's make it the first of many. 
They told me about their grief, and also about their anger and frustration toward a political system that couldn’t seem to take action to prevent other kids from dying from unnecessary gun violence.
If you're on @TimKaine's team tonight, chip in before the #VPDebate to let him know:  
We're utterly failing kids as a society when we build schools to accommodate shooters rather than students. 
Proud of you, Becca!  
A great use of your next hour: Double-check your voter registration and ask two friends to do the same.
Voting should be easy. If it isn't, call the Election Protection hotline at 866-OUR-VOTE with any questions. 
With just 9 days until Election Day, Hillary is campaigning in Florida. Tune in to watch her live: 
Winning back the House was a pipe dream a year ago. @IndivisibleTeam, an @OnwardTogether partner, helped win 40 seats. Now they're going on offense in the House and building power in the states. Read their roadmap for the next two years: 
"Let’s break every record that we’ve ever had for voting. Let’s make that the story of this election.” —Hillary 
An American mother today is 50% more likely to die during childbirth than her own mother. It’s time to tackle the crisis of maternal mortality. #WithoutMom 
Does Trump have the discipline to be a good leader? You decide. 
There are amazing groups at the border and beyond doing critical work to defend the rights of immigrant and refugee children. If you can, please chip in to support a few of them today. 
I was so honored to present #HRCAwards to @mbachelet, @RosacrsJc, and Marta Velásquez at @GIWPS yesterday. They are standing up to human rights abuses, shining a bright light on corruption, and taking on urgent challenges. In times of tumult, they are a beacon of hope. 
By withdrawing from the deal, the administration has effectively broken up the international coalition that was unified in constraining Iran, and now Iran is once again increasing its nuclear capability.
So proud of my friend @Ann_OLeary, who was just announced as Governor @GavinNewsom’s chief of staff. Ann is brilliant, hard-working, and kind. I know her team will do great things for California.
"If you work hard, and you work full-time, you shouldn’t still be in poverty at the end of the year.” —Hillary
Join me, @ChrisMurphyCT, @TimKaine, and a host of Democratic senators and gun violence prevention organizations to help these folks get elected. Chip in today to their campaigns, and your support will be split equally among them. Let’s beat the NR8. 
Women aren't "bossy." We're the boss. Words matter, and being aware of gender bias in the way we relate to each other can make workplaces—and the world—better for everyone. Visit  for tools to #BiasCorrect. #IWD19 
Fourth, vote for state legislature candidates and governors who will support laws that make voting registration automatic, make vote by mail possible, and extend early voting periods. @Sister_District, @flippable_org, and @TheDLCC are excellent organizations to plug into.
A little girl power in Pasadena... 
Today is the final deadline to register to vote in Nevada. Help get the word out: 
“We are stronger together and will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that.” —Hillary
I'm excited to join my old friends and colleagues Jake Sullivan and @Benjamin05055 at Dartmouth's Dickey Center for International Understanding this afternoon. You can watch our conversation live here: 
Hillary and @JamesTaylor_com are live in New Hampshire with two days to go. Watch here: 
It's heartbreaking that a sixth child has died in detention. It's outrageous that we're only learning about it eight months after the fact. 
Every American should watch this.#RightMattersTruthMatters 
We should be heartbroken to see families torn apart, but we should not be hopeless. There’s something you can do right now to help. Make a donation that will be split across eight organizations working to protect kids separated from their families: 
"The president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can’t command his own rhetoric." —@azcentral 
Let's not forget why Trump is attacking Democratic women of color in the first place:They brought attention to the inhumane conditions they saw at this administration's detention camps."What will we say to those we imprisoned for seeking safety?" 
Trump admits he "can't say" he treats women with respect. 
The final margin in the race for Senate in Florida is too close to call, and the Secretary of State has just ordered a recount. Help make sure Senator Nelson's team has everything they need for this process, and that every vote is counted: 
"I don’t believe we’re at our best when we stoke fear about each other.” —HillaryMake a plan to vote if you agree: 
The Court's ruling in Janus v. AFSCME earlier this summer overturned a 40-year-old precedent to hold that public-sector workers with union contracts don't have to pay fees for collective bargaining expenses if they're not members.
Win or lose, what you've built will continue long after last night.
.@Flippable_org is supporting more than 130 candidates in strategic states to flip legislative chambers, build progressive majorities, and restore democracy. Read their plan for your state, then pitch in and volunteer: 
Mike Pence: a divisive, anti-woman, anti-LGBT, anti-worker extremist. No wonder Trump picked him. #VPDebate 
The president takes an oath to "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution." Does Trump know what's in it? 
We've heard Donald's insults for years, and his policies reflect this disregard—even contempt—for women.
"She is a fighter for what is right, what is fair, and what is just." —@RepJohnLewis:  
Mike Pence's #VPDebate strategy seemed to be "if you close your eyes, Trump doesn't exist." 
Trump says disqualifying things almost every day—but his policy "plans" matter too. We put them next to Hillary's: 
Two states have voter registration deadlines today:Connecticut: Deadline to register in person, by mail, or online. You can also register at a local election office through Election Day.Utah: Deadline to register in person or online.For more, go to 
"We have still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling. But some day, someone will." —Hillary
No matter where you go to college, we’ll make it easier for you to pay back and pay down your student debt. 
Reproductive rights are human rights—all around the world. 
I talked to @GMA about "Hillary," a docuseries that premieres on Hulu on Friday. It's a story not only about me but about the lives of millions of women in our country. 
@tarabea80 @BillClinton What kind words Tara. It was great meeting you last night, and thanks for writing!
Trump wants to give trillions in tax cuts to millionaires and corporations. It’s trickle-down economics on steroids. 
If you're thinking about running for office, take the @traindems 30-day challenge. By the end of April, you'll have the knowledge you need to run. Sign up now, and bring along a friend to join you: 
Remember, don't believe the haters who describe America as hopeless and broken. We should lift each other up, not tear each other down.
"Are we going to build a better, stronger America—or are we going to fear each other, and fear our future?" —Hillary
Congratulations to everyone who helped achieve this! Registering voters and turning them out is how we'll overcome voter suppression and any foreign interference in our elections in 2020, and we all have to be clear about that. 
If we unite together, we will rise together. 
"We don’t want to shrink the vision of this country. We want to keep expanding it.” —Hillary
A shameful failure of policy &amp; morality by GOP today. Fight back on behalf of the millions of families that will be hurt by their actions: 
"This is a woman I have never met...but who has stood with my family and me over and over again." 
20 days left. Let's win this.Make your custom video to show the world why you believe that #LoveTrumpsHate: 
Lucky to have a partner like @TimKaine who stood up for our shared vision tonight—instead of trying to deny it. #VPDebate
If you're thinking about working on a campaign in 2020, take advantage of @ArenaSummit's next Arena Academy this September in Houston. They're an @OnwardTogether partner devoted to helping staff and candidates get the skills they need to win. Learn more: 
Trump has contributed $0 for our military, $0 for Pell Grants to help people afford college, $0 for our highways. 
"If you vote for someone other than Hillary—or if you don't vote at all—then you are helping to elect her opponent." —@FLOTUS 
As I told @Columbia students last night:For all the progress we've made on civil rights and women's rights, there are people working to turn back the clock—and now many of them have lifetime appointments on the federal bench. Get involved in the public sphere. Push for change. 
Let’s be clear: Women have just as much right as men to make the most personal health decisions without government interference. We are equal citizens and we will insist on nothing less in this country. Please call your senators and relay the message: (202) 224-3121
The inspiring Lucy McBath became an activist for common-sense gun reform after her son, Jordan, was shot and killed. This cycle, she ran for Congress in a heavily Republican district in Georgia—and it looks likely she will win.
Three headlines:1. The US held a record number of migrant children in custody in 2019.  Hate crimes hit a 16-year high in 2018.  One of the president’s senior advisors is an avowed white supremacist. 
We are going to end the federal government making money off of lending money to get your education. 
These are just a few of countless stories that we should never read about events happening within our borders.
Thank you to all the readers who helped put "The Book of Gutsy Women" at the top of the list! @ChelseaClinton and I are so thrilled to share these women's stories with you.  
For more than 30 years, @emilyslist has paved the way for women to run &amp; succeed in elected office, including me.
Trump doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to women's health. He shouldn't be making the decisions. #DebateNight
A lot has changed in the past two and a half decades. But the things we’re fighting for remain the same. 
Fact check:True. 
@NancyEMcFadden Nancy has a record of beating the odds - from DC to CA - where she helped Gov Brown do a fantastic job. All who know her are sending strength &amp; love as she faces this latest challenge.  Onward my friend. -H
In 2007, Kavanaugh wrote an opinion that severely limited union rights and allowed major damage to federal workers' ability to bargain collectively.
"What’s really on the ballot is what kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren.” —Hillary 
Well said. It can't be easy to be a teenager right now—thank you for teaching yours about what we all owe to each other. 
It was such an honor and delight to kick off the tour for "Gutsy Women" with one of the gutsiest athletes and advocates for equality of all time. Thank you, @BillieJeanKing! 
Make sure your family and friends see the evidence for themselves: The president asked a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election for his own political gain. Americans deserve free and fair elections. He must be held accountable. 
"Sometimes the man in the arena, it ain't a man. It is a woman." —@CoryBooker 
This #EarthDay, I'm thankful for the millions of young people around the world who have marched and gone on strike to demand action on climate change. We know what we need to do: Cut greenhouse emissions in half by 2030. Now we need to do it.
I was so honored to be invited to participate in the #SelmaJubilee this weekend.We're living through a full-fledged crisis in our democracy. But history teaches us that when the struggle feels the hardest is when marching forward is most important. 
Trump stood on a debate stage and lied to millions of Americans.Chip in to make sure he never becomes president:  
When there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit.  
Great piece about a great guy I’ve known for a long time.
"Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for anyone who makes less than $125,000 a year.” —Hillary 
Trump stood up at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation—one that in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America we know.
Before Mike Pence takes the debate stage to defend his running mate, remember the time Trump couldn't decide whether he wanted him at all. 
Imagine how this can play out. A woman living in El Salvador, where abortion is banned, is raped and becomes pregnant. She suffers a miscarriage and decides to flee the country knowing that 17 of her countrywomen were sentenced to up to 40 years in prison after miscarrying.
Congress needs to act to make voting by mail the norm going forward, with the specifics outlined by election expert Marc Elias below to make it accessible for all. 
"She doesn't always talk about what drives her. But I've had a chance to see her." —@POTUS 
Donald Trump refuses to be subject to the law. The legitimacy of our elections is in doubt. The president is waging war on the truth. The administration is undermining the national unity that makes democracy possible. And then there's the breathtaking corruption.
In the face of an administration that doesn’t care about the middle class, this is a bold, impressive step by Amazon. Kudos to Jeff Bezos and the employees fighting for 15. 
“We have never had a more qualified and prepared candidate for president than our friend Hillary.” —@FLOTUS  
Across America, people are rejecting Trump’s dark vision for one that is hopeful and inclusive and unifying. 
.@TimKaine is going to finish this campaign the same way he started his career—fighting for working families. 
We’re going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century. 
.@iVoteFund has defended democracy itself, fighting hard against voter suppression and for secretaries of state and local measures that will make it easier for every American to exercise their right to vote.
Watch live: Hillary campaigns in Des Moines, IA with 11 days to go →  a plan to vote: 
Newspapers that have endorsed @realDonaldTrump:1. ...2. ...3. (Uh, the National Enquirer?) 
Honest work deserves honest pay. Everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back.
To the women sworn in to Congress today, the most in our history: Congratulations. Knock it out of the park. 
Thanks to all of you, we have now crossed the $500,000 mark. Here’s where your generosity is going, let’s keep it up! @ACLU@asylumadvocacy@FlorenceProject@humanrights1st@supportKIND@LUPE_rgv@RAICESTEXAS@UNITEDWEDREAM@WomenBelong@wrcommission 
Quick update, and great news: Legislators passed Rhode Island’s Reproductive Privacy Act and @GovRaimondo signed it into law last night! It was a close vote, so thanks again to everyone who called, wrote, and visited their representatives to protect reproductive rights.
Thanks to Pres Johnson &amp; the entire Wellesley community. And congrats to Wellesley's first NCAA crew champions, thanks for the warm welcome! 
White people need to empathize and understand what it’s like for black parents to worry about their kids' safety. 
There’s new CDC data out about gun deaths in America. Last year saw the most gun deaths in 40 years, nearly 40,000 people. What is wrong with us? This is not a problem we should have at all, let alone one that’s getting worse.
Our children are watching to see what kind of example we set for them. 
Speaking of gutsy women… 
Trump's major policy proposal is to "build a wall" and have Mexico pay for it. He choked. Enough said. #DebateNight 
Glad Secretary Carter did the right thing. Our men and women in uniform deserve our support and deepest gratitude, not an undue burden. -H 
"Hillary Clinton is a fighter for all of us. She's the fighter we need." 
"No one could be more qualified for this job than Hillary, no one.” —@FLOTUS
Donald—his father Fred—and their entire company were sued by @TheJusticeDept for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos.
Can’t wait to meet you, Bonnie! And thanks so much to everyone who entered my @omaze campaign in support of @OnwardTogether. 
Happy Mother's Day! 
Polls are open. Confirm where you'll vote: 
Our choice is between the most qualified candidate in decades—and a man who once started a Twitter war with Cher.  
"Our hope is grounded in hard work and hard-earned faith...that we are all precious and worthy, no matter where we come from." —@FLOTUS
As of today, this shutdown is the longest in history. The costs are already high: People are missing paychecks, losing business, or working without pay. Our national parks are overrun with trash. The FDA and FBI warn of the harm to our food safety and national security.
Now copy my plan on health care, a fairer tax system, and voting rights.  
"When you're president...knowing what you're doing is a good thing.And Hillary Clinton absolutely knows what she's doing." —@FLOTUS
The real national emergencies:- Relentless gun violence. - Children separated from their families at the border.- Climate change.- Americans dying for lack of health care.
@lizzo "I just took a DNA test, turns out..."
Make time for this important conversation between 42 and 43 about how grappling with differences can lead to meaningful change. 
People are mobilizing across the country today to #StopKavanaugh. Find an event near you: 
For 72 years, @TIME named a Man of the Year. For their 100 Women of the Year project, they chose some new faces to highlight, and I’m honored to be included alongside 99 remarkable women.  
This is grotesque. 
Imagine if a Democratic 2020 candidate said: "China, if you're listening..." Just saying that shows the absurdity of the situation we find ourselves in. 
“Get out and vote. Get out and vote for Hillary. Vote early. Vote right now!” —@
Facts:- Puerto Ricans are Americans.- Puerto Ricans have not received $91 billion in aid. - Puerto Rico is still waiting for the help its government should provide as they rebuild after 3,000 deaths and horrific damage.
Enter now for your once-in-a-lifetime chance to fly for free with Hillary on the official campaign plane: 
The rumors are true: @ChelseaClinton and I are @TrevorNoah fans. Thanks for having us on to talk #gutsywomen, @TheDailyShow!  
Unions and labor movements are why we have workplace safety precautions, collective bargaining, weekends, minimum wages, and, yes, Labor Day. We can't afford more damage to workers' rights. Make sure your senators hear from you: Let's #StopKavanaugh.
Exciting to see the grassroots army that @swingleft is organizing to help expand the map in 2018! Learn more here: 
On top of human suffering and lasting damage to our national parks, the Trump shutdown cost the economy $11 billion. End shutdowns as a political hostage-taking tactic. 
We should all care about how social media platforms play a part in our democratic process. Because unless it’s addressed it will happen again. The midterms are in 8 months. We owe it to our democracy to get this right, and fast. 
Tune in now to watch Hillary kick off Iowa early voting live from Des Moines: 
"This loss hurts. But please never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it." —Hillary
.@ArenaSummit, an @OnwardTogether partner, is offering a new Arena Academy program to help aspiring organizers and campaign staffers get the skills they need. The early decision deadline for February's session is this Friday: 
Imagine that it’s January 20, 2017. Ask yourself, what will life be like for you under President Trump?→ 
Contributing nothing to our military, public schools, kids' health care, and more doesn't make you "smart." 
One of the most stunning statistics from the 2016 election is that nearly 42% of eligible voters didn't vote. Historically, midterm turnout is even lower than the turnout rate for presidential years. But we can't afford for anyone to stay home. 
Looking forward to sitting down with Bill and the one and only @StarJonesEsq in Connecticut tonight. Star has already mentioned she wants to talk Mueller, so we'll talk about the report—along with some lighter topics! See you in a bit, Wallingford.
Watch live: Hillary Clinton speaks at the In Defense of Democracy event presented by @ShankerInst, @AFTUnion, and @OnwardTogether. 
“Hello Philadelphia! Are you fired up? Are you ready to go?” —@POTUS 
Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?
Here's what foreign policy experts, diplomats, and world leaders think about Hillary's four years as America's secretary of state: 
The administration's attacks on climate science are a betrayal of future generations that we have to work to reverse as soon as possible. 
I was honored to close out @NARAL's 50th anniversary celebration last night. The work to defend reproductive rights is more urgent now than ever.
"Go to  because...there’s only one way we lose this election, just one: if we don’t turn out to vote.” —@POTUS
“The Trump administration likely separated thousands more children from their parents at the Southern border than was previously believed.” This is an outrage! We need hearings, answers, and solutions immediately. 
On Friday night, I got the chance to call in to #HillaryonHulu watch parties happening around the country to say hi and thanks. Love you guys. 
So proud of the @runforsomething team on hitting this milestone! It takes a lot of courage to put your name on a ballot, and I'm glad these 500+ candidates have Run for Something in their corner. 
Twenty-one states are filing lawsuits this week to stop the administration's gag rule on clinics referring women for abortions. As @OregonGovBrown said: Everyone deserves the ability make their own decisions about their health care. 
Thank you to everyone who called CBP or their member of Congress this weekend to help a group of families in Mexicali get re-entry to the U.S. This is a huge step forward in getting them reunited with their kids. 
When Hillary wanted to make sure every child in Arkansas got a quality education, she did her homework. 
Time to bring CHIP to the Senate floor as promised. This alleged extension until March doesn’t cut it as states freeze enrollment &amp; send out letters warning that coverage will end. This is frightening to parents &amp; wreaks havoc for states. 
"We want someone who is a unifying force in this country, who sees our differences not as a threat, but as as blessing." —@FLOTUS
“It’s becoming clear that, to him, most of America is ‘them.’” —@FLOTUS on Donald Trump 
"I've known Hillary since September of 1958...we were just thinking of the next Nancy Drew book." —Hillary's lifelong friend, Betsy 
Our democracy is in crisis. The president degrades the rule of law, spreads corruption, and discredits truth. Over the next three weeks, we all have a chance to turn back the tide. Here are three things you can do before November 6:
Sharing some happy news this morning! Bill and I are so thrilled. 
I still believe in the vision we share for our country. We will elect politicians and enact legislation to protect the most vulnerable among us – but first, we have to address the urgent needs of families at the center of this crisis. Give today. Please. 
Yes we can.

Tune in NOW to watch my panel with @laurenepowell at #ozyfest2018 where we’ll discuss all that’s happening in the world, why we should all still be optimists, and where we go from here.
None of us should accept a future in which our daughters and granddaughters have fewer rights than we do. Choose a way to help, ask a friend to join you, and let's get to work.
There’s a lot to be frustrated by right now, to say the least. Here’s something that we should be able to fix.
We've always had destructive hurricanes, but Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change.
Rudy should really consider taking up @jkcorden on the offer of a free exorcism. 
Congratulations to @AshantiGholar and @EmergeAmerica! Excited to work with you to recruit and help elect a historic number of women to office. 
Just this year, the Court upheld purges of minority voters in Ohio as well as districts in Texas that were drawn to reduce the voting power of people of color. With a solid hard-right majority on the Court, we would see more decisions like those.
Historian @alexiscoe's new book about George Washington, "You Never Forget Your First," is a fresh perspective on the man who helped define the American presidency. A timely read on the eve of an impeachment vote:  
A man who disrespects our service members cannot be our Commander-in-Chief. 
Latino political power is growing across the country, thanks to the hard work of activists and organizations around the country. Proud that @OnwardTogether groups are among them! 
With just 4 days left, join Hillary and @MCuban as they get out the vote in Pittsburgh:

Challenges to the Affordable Care Act's protections for patients, including the notion that insurance companies can't refuse to insure you if you have a pre-existing condition, are already working their way through the lower courts.
America is already great because it welcomes people like Damián López Rodriguez—an immigrant who gave his life for our country. 
Next Tuesday's elections will determine whether Virginia gets fair congressional maps for the next decade. If you have a spare hour or two this weekend, you can help turn voters out from wherever you are: 
"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted."So must we all.
Like I said: A puppet. 
Congrats to the #USWNT for earning that tea. On to the final! 🇺🇸 
The choice on climate change:Hillary has a plan to turn America into a clean energy superpower.Trump calls it a "Chinese hoax." 
In the face of extreme abortion bans sweeping the country, we all have to stand up for women's rights. At noon tomorrow, join @PPAct, @NARAL, @OnwardTogether partner @IndivisibleTeam, and other groups to #StopTheBans. Find an event near you:

What's "smart" about not funding America's military, schools, or health care for kids? 
I'm endlessly impressed by the no-nonsense, hope-fueled, incredibly effective @IndivisibleTeam movement. (It's why we asked them to be an @OnwardTogether partner!) Now their most valuable principles and lessons are in a new book: 
Trump said he’s "very proud” to lead the birther movement to discredit @POTUS. Here’s how he spread the racist lie: 
"I want you hustling all the way until the polls close on November 8." —@POTUS  
Racist words can do real harm to people, especially when they're spoken by the president of the United States. Enough with the words to divert us. We need actions to protect us.
It's hard to process that our country is committing such abuses—and against children—in our name. But let's not stop at outrage or heartbreak.
Everyone deserves affordable health insurance. Head over to  and shop for a plan that's right for you. 
I’m so heartened by all of you. Onward! 
"If you elect me on Tuesday, that’s the kind of president I will be: listening, working, finding common ground.”

Donald Trump just got one of his only newspaper endorsements of this election...from the Ku Klux Klan. 
More than ever, I believe citizen engagement is vital to our democracy. I'm so inspired by everyone stepping up to organize and lead.
Born before women could vote, Ruline just cast her ballot for Hillary in Iowa today. Join her:  
We need to improve and protect our elections, from instituting paper ballot backups to repairing the Voting Rights Act, getting secret money out of politics, and—you won't be surprised to hear my support for this—abolishing the Electoral College.

Two years ago this week, the president signed an executive order banning travelers from Muslim-majority countries. The consequences have been tragic, for families and for our country. Congress should hold the administration to account. 
.@EmergeAmerica has recruited and trained thousands of Democratic women to run for office, and 560 of their alums will be on the ballot in two weeks. Historic numbers of women are running all over the country. We're at the beginning of a new era. 
"Vladimir Putin...isn't my best friend." —Donald Trump #DebateNight 
Our success isn't measured by the size of our bank accounts or the height of our skyscrapers. It's measured by what we do for kids. 
If you believe everyone deserves to be treated equally, no matter who they are or who they love—you’ve got to vote. 
The next Supreme Court justice will have a chance to rule on the fate of the Affordable Care Act, which helps millions of people get affordable health care. Brett Kavanaugh’s record shows he’d be a threat to the law.
Wishing love, hope, and renewal to everyone celebrating Easter today.
According to @NYTimes, Trump may contribute less to our military and college students than the undocumented immigrants he wants to deport.
Donald Trump might have gone decades without paying taxes—but he’s not afraid of telling other people to pay theirs.

We can’t make progress if the will of the people isn’t represented at the voting booth. Join us for today’s In Defense of Democracy event, where you’ll hear from @rweingarten, @andrewgillum, @ronwyden, and more—with a keynote from me at 9:30am ET. 
Trump's plan wouldn't just cut taxes for rich people—it would raise taxes for millions of middle-class families. 
So thrilled to be with @GabbyGiffords, @ShuttleCDRKelly, &amp; so many others tonight at the 25th anniversary celebration of the Giffords Law Center. Tune in now.
The Trump administration was told in January that coronavirus was likely to become a pandemic. They refused to act for fear of spooking the markets, losing weeks of time to prepare that we won’t get back. 
“You can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted vision for America.” —Hillary  
I've done my share of interviews in my lifetime, but nothing like this. I surprised myself a few times while participating in this documentary. Maybe you'll be surprised, too. 
"This was not just 'locker room banter.' This was a powerful individual speaking freely &amp; openly about predatory behavior” —@FLOTUS on Trump
We are all safer when everyone has respect for the law, and everyone is respected by the law.

We’re going to make public colleges tuition-free for families making less than $125,000 a year and debt-free for everyone else.
Every American should read the evidence for themselves in the House’s impeachment inquiry report.It catalogues “a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.” 
On November 9, what kind of world do you want to wake up in? 
This is as serious as it gets. It's up to us to save health care for millions of our fellow Americans—again. As Kavanaugh's hearings begin, make sure your senators hear from you: (202) 224-3121

The world is watching. Northern Ireland has been a symbol to people everywhere of democracy’s power to transcend divisions and deliver prosperity, peace, and progress. We need that symbol, that reality, now more than ever.
From helping to lead @domesticworkers to protesting family separation, @JessLivMo is not only tireless—she is fearless. 
"Whether you agree or disagree with me, whether you vote for me or not, I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable.” —Hillary
.@JulietteKayyem makes a chilling point in her @washingtonpost op-ed today about the way shooters' use of barrel suppressors and other silencing equipment makes it harder for people to save themselves and others. The sound of gunfire can save lives. 
Cassandra Levesque is only 19 years old, but she already has a successful statewide campaign under her belt: She spent four years working with her legislator to end child marriage in New Hampshire. Now she's running for state rep herself. 
One of the most fundamental human rights is the right to make the most personal decisions about one's own body. To deny women that is to rob them of the ability to decide their own futures.
As Secretary of State, I helped negotiate the crippling international sanctions that brought Iran to the table. It would be much harder a second time, now that our credibility is shot.
Hear @chelseaclinton talk about Too Small To Fail, an initiative we started at the @clintonfdn to improve the health and well-being of children under five: 
"Women's rights are human rights"—and 132 more reasons Hillary should be our next president. 
This Republican dad is struggling with the idea of his daughter growing up in a country led by Donald Trump. 
This is a heart-wrenching disgrace. 
Thanks, @chancetherapper. 
You can say that again. 
“We should all be grateful that this remarkable family decided to make America their home.” —Hillary on the Khan family
"I said no to some jokes that I thought were over the line, but I suppose you can judge for yourself on Wikileaks in the next few days."
Can a man who lost $1 billion in one year, stiffed small businesses, and may have paid no taxes really claim he's "good at business"? 
We will not and cannot accept this. 
We must remember and reaffirm that gun violence is not an intractable problem. We will not accept it. We know what to do to solve it. @MomsDemand, @Everytown, @AMarch4OurLives, and so many others are making progress every day.
"I want an America where everyone has a place, where everyone is included.” —Hillary in Ohio 
There are just 39 days between now &amp; November 8. Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes. 
A month ago, Trump said: “It’s going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” Yesterday, he said: “I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.” What will it take to get @realdonaldtrump to listen to experts instead of his own hunches?
Mourning the loss today of @ArethaFranklin who shared her spirit and talent with the world. She deserves not only our RESPECT but also our lasting gratitude for opening our eyes, ears and hearts. Rest in eternal peace, my friend.
No matter how much of a grown-up you become, you'll always be my baby. Happy birthday, @ChelseaClinton. 
"I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience with your 30 years." —Hillary to Trump #DebateNight 
Our work is far from over. As we celebrate our wins, let's be clear about what's ahead. This is a crucial step in a long road to repairing our democracy. It'll take all of us to do it. What a start this is.

Trump's child care "plan" is really just a tax cut for the wealthy—while giving working families almost nothing. 
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr was in Memphis in 1968 to protest with sanitation workers the week he was killed. Here’s the story of one of those workers, Cleophus Smith, who is still on the job today.
It was a thrill to work on this project with @ElaineWelteroth.  I’m really proud of the result. I hope you enjoy it.

.@MichaelNutter got a lot of great points into 140 characters here. We have to keep the momentum. 
The Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 by ruling that states with a history of suppression no longer needed federal approval to change their voting laws. Kavanaugh's record indicates he would help a new majority kill the VRA entirely and approve even more suppression.

Dozens of former nuclear launch officers agree: Donald Trump should never be in charge of America's nuclear weapons.
Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change or drag us backward and put our whole future at risk.
Yes, I am famously under-scrutinized.

The Trump administration must answer for this and make tests widely accessible immediately to help front-line health care workers do their jobs. 
Tonight, Alabama voters elected a senator who'll make them proud. And if Democrats can win in Alabama, we can -- and must -- compete everywhere.Onward!
The administration's deadline to reunite families it separated at the border passed 12 weeks ago today. What is their plan to rectify this great wrong, and to do it immediately?
Donald Trump refused to say that he’d respect the results of this election. By doing that, he’s threatening our democracy.
Nine years since Citizens United, the amount of money in politics hasn't changed dramatically. But who funds politics has: "a handful of donors who make multimillion dollar contributions." The result: disastrous laws like Trump's tax giveaway to the rich. 
Thousands of DACA recipients have been unable to renew the legal protections they need to live and work safely because of $495 application fees. @DreamBigNV, an @OnwardTogether grantee, is raising money to help cover costs. If you can, chip in here: 
Trump is using the powers of the presidency like a tyrant—now, to reward accomplices and go after witnesses who dared to speak against him. This should concern and anger us all.

Thinking about Barbara Bush’s legacy of service to our country and the extraordinary family she raised. Thanking her for her many kindnesses to me and my family. Wishing her the comfort she deserves surrounded by her loved ones.
When anti-choice politicians limit access to reproductive care, women die. Please read @ilyseh on why we must continue to fight the new wave of six-week abortion bans that make women collateral damage for extremist views: 
“I will do everything I can to get incomes rising again for hardworking people…you deserve to be part of a growing, thriving middle class.”

Happy Pride Month! Gay rights are human rights, now and forever. This administration's attacks on the LGBTQ+ community can never change that, and I'm proud to stand and fight with you to make sure those rights are recognized as they should be. 🌈
What can we do? Make sure your representatives are holding the administration accountable for this attack on our health care; organize to build political support for more coverage for more people. Health care is a human right, and we can realize that right in America.

As 2020 policy discussion gears up, @genebsperling’s piece on the dignity of work is terrific food for thought on why conversations about economic opportunity shouldn’t be confined to traditional metrics. After all, economic opportunity is about people. 
Let’s try this again, @realdonaldtrump:Hospitals are already running out of ventilators and beds. Nurses are using bandanas as masks.If you’ve already ordered more with the Defense Production Act, tell us now. If you haven’t, you’re failing to lead and failing Americans.
There's a concrete way you can help immigrant children and their families at the border today. The Trump administration wants to change regulations to allow indefinite detention. Make a public comment to DHS about why you oppose the policy: 
The FDA approved the very first birth control pill 59 years ago today, and the world opened up for women. Reproductive freedom is simply the foundation of women’s ability to achieve their dreams. We have to continue defending it. #ThxBirthControl
Richard Nixon once made this argument: "When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal." He was forced to resign in disgrace. In America, no one is above the law.

Of particular note: U.S. immigration judges and asylum officers use the human rights reports to evaluate the credibility of an applicant's fear of persecution. Human rights reports that contradict an asylum seeker in virtually any way can be fatal to an asylum application.
Republicans in Michigan and Wisconsin lost elections on Nov. 6. Rather than respect the will of voters, they're using their last few weeks in office to pass laws limiting the power of new governors and put roadblocks on voting. It's not just anti-Democratic. It's anti-democratic.
Talk to your loved ones about this election—there's too much at stake to sit out.   
When the Trump administration threatened to pull out of the Iran deal and impose more sanctions last year, it was clear that we'd lose our leverage and Iran would be free to do what it wanted. Predictably, Iran is now exceeding enrichment limits the deal once imposed.

The many, many lies Mike Pence told at last night's debate. 
Trump owes the country an apology for all of the horrible things he's said. It's time for him to take responsibility for his words.

As a federal judge, Kavanaugh tried to prevent a young undocumented woman in government custody from exercising her right to an abortion.
Trump has said that the video doesn't represent who he is. Anyone who heard it knows it's exactly who he is.But that's not who we are.
This is despicable. The Trump administration is not only ceding America’s role as a leader on the human rights of women, it’s actively working against those rights. We all have to work together to right this wrong and undo this damage.

Nine @IndivisibleTeam-endorsed candidates won. Overall, the margin in their endorsed races swung 8 points to the left. Among races rated “Solid R," that swing was 15 points.

"The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election... shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax." Amendment 24, Section 1. 
While Donald continues day 5 of his Machado meltdown, we'll be in Florida talking about national service. You'll want to watch.
The choice we face on climate change. 
"27 million strong all ready to vote for freedom, equality, and reason—traits that seem to have gone out of season." 
Equality is on the ballot.Justice is on the ballot.Our progress is on the ballot.

“I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we’re going and how we’re going to get there.” —Hillary
On #InternationalWomensDay and every day, let’s say out loud once more that women’s rights are human rights—and no administration, political party, court, legislature, or biased attitudes can change that. 
I agree with Chelsea: We all have a real responsibility to protect each other right now. 
When Mike Pence says he and Donald Trump won't raise taxes, he's lying.  #VPDebate
"You are right about Islamophobia, and it's a shame." —Donald Trump, who proposed a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. 
The Trump administration opened a new assault on Americans' health care yesterday by telling a federal appeals court that the entire law should be struck down. It's a sickening attack on people with pre-existing conditions, seniors, and young people. 
Follow @TheBriefing2016 during tonight's debate so you can help hold Trump accountable to the facts. RT to spread the word. #DebateNight
We will not step backward. If this is not who we are as Americans, let's prove it.
By Monday, @OnwardTogether partner @arenasummit will have trained almost 1,000 new staffers for progressive campaigns through #ArenaAcademy. Sign up to be notified when applications for the next training open up: 
The same guy who probably didn't pay federal taxes for 18 years is OK raising taxes on millions in the middle-class. Sound right to you?
It's 3:20am. As good a time as any to tweet about national service. 
Love this. Follow Madeleine's lead and apply! #AllTheHouses 
Kavanaugh ruled to let CEOs decide to deny their employees insurance coverage for no co-pay birth control.
With threats &amp; hate crimes on rise, we shouldn't have to tell @POTUS to do his part. He must step up &amp; speak out.
With just 5 days until Election Day, watch Hillary speak live in North Carolina: 
Women’s rights are human rights. That was a radical idea back in 1995. It shouldn’t still be two decades later.
Families across America had to start 2018 worried that their kids wouldn’t have health care. Failing to act now shows the true face of Republicans &amp; their donor-driven immoral agenda. You control the Senate agenda @SenateMajLdr. Enough is enough.
This is the most groundbreaking Crim Pro I’ve seen since I taught it at Arkansas myself (during the late Middle Ages, after the bubonic plague and before the coronavirus). 
The administration just put a gag rule in place that bars Title X health care providers from referring patients for safe and legal abortions. It's an attack on Planned Parenthood and 1.6 million patients who may not be able to afford care anywhere else. #IStandWithPP #NoGagRule
First: We’ve got to mobilize turnout in the midterms. There are fantastic candidates all over the country who’ll do great things, and we could finally see some congressional oversight of the White House.
We are seeing large numbers of people turning out, breaking records.Make sure you’re ready to vote, too: 
Sen. @kamalaharris asked Brett Kavanaugh last week: "Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?" He said he was not. Because there are none.
Can't wait. Join us! 
"When you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of our elections—then that undermines our democracy." —@POTUS
Newspapers across the country are almost exclusively endorsing Hillary over Trump. 
"We have a chance to elect a 45th president who will build on our progress, who will finish the job.” —@POTUS
Congratulations to Gov. @JohnBelForLa for winning a new term as governor of Louisiana—and to New Orleans and @mayorcantrell for voter access and mobilization that helped lead to the city's 90% vote share for Edwards! #geauxvote
It's more important than ever this week to remember the children who have still not been reunited with their families after this administration separated them at the border months ago. Vote to repudiate this horrendous policy. Vote to reject the bigotry that led to it.
When Trump trivializes the sacrifice of our military and veterans, he makes it clear: He has no idea what service to this country means. 
At least 32 million nurses, caregivers, and food service workers in America don't have access to any paid sick leave. It's morally wrong and, as the coronavirus crisis makes clear, it puts us all at risk. 
Russia’s seizure last week of three Ukrainian boats and their 24 crew members in the Kerch Strait is a significant Russian military escalation with respect to Ukraine and the latest attempt by Russia to control key areas in and around Ukraine.
They tell me about 10% of first-time candidates usually win, but 40% of @runforsomething candidates came out on top yesterday.
"If we have a president who...brags about sexually assaulting women, then how can we maintain our moral authority in the world?" —@FLOTUS
"We want a president who understands that this nation was built by people who came here from all corners of the world." —@FLOTUS
Watch &amp; prepare to tear up. Thanks @jimmykimmel for sharing your story &amp; reminding us what's at stake w/health care.
"Everyone knows how bright she is and how resilient she is, but...they're going to see how much she cares." —@JoeBiden 
"If a candidate regularly and flippantly makes cruel and insulting comments about women...that's who that candidate really is." —@FLOTUS 
"When you work full-time, you shouldn’t still be living in poverty, worrying about whether you can put food on the table.” —Hillary
This is heartbreaking. No child in America should feel afraid to practice their religion or embrace their heritage. 
When I met @MeehanBM she was a bright young foreign service officer. Now she’s leading a panel of fellow senior diplomats to kick off our “Future of Diplomacy” symposium today at 
Congrats to @DNC chair @TomPerez &amp; deputy @keithellison. Excited for strong, unified party standing for best of our country into the future.

This is a great way to help fight the fires in the Amazon. One hundred percent of donations go to partners working on the ground: 
"Nobody respects women more than me." —Donald TrumpOther things he's said about women: 
Wow. In just the few short hours since I tweeted, this community has donated nearly $150,000 to support these groups’ critical work. If you’re as heartbroken and infuriated about what’s happening as I am, help keep it going:  
But this fight isn't over yet and we can't forget who it's about. Here are some stories...
.@BillClinton on the 20th anniversary of the Columbine school shooting: “The powerful example of today’s young activists, and the enduring commitment of Columbine survivors and their supporters, give us hope that we can pass sensible gun legislation.” 
Under @jacindaardern's leadership, New Zealand has banned assault rifles and military-style semi-automatic weapons just six days after the Christchurch mosque attacks. Public servants didn't stop at offering thoughts and prayers. They chose to act. 
Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, is overseeing his own election for governor and has put 53,000 voter registrations on hold, 70% of them from black voters, because they don't adhere to an "exact match" standard of name spellings. 
"If you want hope instead of fear, then you will elect Hillary Clinton as president of the United States.” —@POTUS 
“The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining.” 
Six reasons you need to vote, courtesy of @FLOTUS.  
People suffer from mental illness in every other country on earth; people play video games in virtually every other country on earth.The difference is the guns.
In 70 countries, it's still a crime to be LGBTQ+. Hope you'll listen to this important conversation about pride, progress, and the work we still have to do for equality. #Stonewall50 
To make change this year, don't just vote--volunteer. Commit to taking action in this year's midterms starting now, but especially on #TheLastWeekend when it matters most.
If you want a career in politics but don’t know where to start, take a look at the @TrainDems staff academy. Their mission is to recruit, train, and help place the next generation of Democratic campaign staff: 
The presidency doesn’t change who you are—it reveals who you are. And we’ve seen all we need to of Donald Trump.
.@ColorOfChange and @DomesticWorkers have spent the last two years waging campaigns to defend civil rights against the administration's attacks and building powerful communities for change.
Love this tribute to community colleges and their talented students! 
Only 71 left! Hurry and save $10 on the Art of Politics tote here:  
“More than 16.5 million people have already voted in this election.” —HillaryJoin them: 
As millions of people around the country pull together to save lives and keep each other healthy, I wanted to take a moment to share what a few of our @OnwardTogether partners and grantees have done to fill gaps in our systems and keep pushing for progress. I'm grateful for them.
"He was a failure at business…and by wrecking his business, he wrecked the lives of his workers.” —Hillary on Trump
So exciting! 
Reminder: Donald Trump may not have paid any federal income taxes for 18 years, but wants to give his family a $4 billion tax cut. #VPDebate
@emilyslist Their determination &amp; passion is truly inspiring. And I can't wait to see what this new generation of women leaders accomplishes. Onward!
I talk a lot about reading, singing, &amp; talking to your children so they have the tools they need when they enter school. @bethkobliner takes the next step, teaming up with the great Kate McKinnon to teach kids financial literacy. It’s fun, check it out! 
"I voted for Hillary Clinton because I am absolutely confident that when she is president, this country will be in good hands.” —@POTUS 
Congratulations to everyone graduating this spring!Remember, it's not whether you get knocked down that matters—it's whether you get back up and keep going. 
Get out and vote.Get everybody you know to vote.This is one of the most consequential elections in our lifetimes. 
The future of our economy is at stake.LGBT equality is at stake.Equal pay for women is at stake.Go vote: 
When @RunForSomething launched, they expected to find 100 people who wanted to run for local office. Instead, they've recruited 17,000 young candidates in all 50 states, built a network of 6,000 volunteers, and endorsed 308 candidates. Their new goal: recruit 50k candidates.
Important legislation introduced yesterday: The Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act would correct the Trump administration's dangerous decision to remove reporting on reproductive rights from the State Department's annual reports on human rights practices around the world.
We have another chance to make progress this fall, when eight brave candidates for Congress will be on the ballot facing some of the gun lobby's biggest defenders.

Three of my favorites—@aliciagarza, @aijenpoo, and @aminatou—talk on Alicia and Ai-jen's new @sunstormpod about Shine Theory and the power women generate when we get together to make change. The key: "I don't shine if you don't shine."  
The energy we’re seeing out there isn’t just about what we’re against—it’s about what we’re for: a future in which everyone counts.
Glad to see this important voice join the fight to end a heartbreakingly harmful practice: The American Medical Association has called for a nationwide ban on so-called "conversion therapy." 
Virginians: my friends @RalphNortham @FairfaxJustin @MarkHerringVA need you to show up and vote to get across the finish line.
To all the candidates, staff, and volunteers who have worked their hearts out for presidential campaigns that have ended—remember that fighting for what you believe in is always worth it.
Hi, London! I made a surprise stop at the Sky Leadership event to announce a new scholarship program from @SkyUK &amp; @SwanseaUni. It’ll give students the chance to design a one-year master's at The Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law to study issues relating to children’s welfare. 
Mitch McConnell reportedly has no interest in putting the #ForThePeople Act up to a vote in the Senate. Kentuckians: If you agree that we need to get money out of our politics and protect the right to vote, make sure he hears from you. 
"If his closest advisors don’t trust him to tweet, why would any of us trust him with the nuclear codes?” —@POTUS on Trump
This is an attack on the humanity of transgender people and it cannot stand. Let's send a clear message that we won't sit back and allow this type of discrimination in two weeks at the ballot box. 
"The Dispatch urges voters to elect Hillary Clinton." —@DispatchAlerts  #OHVotesEarly
The theater adaptation of Network, @NetworkBway, makes Paddy Chayefsky's story about the blurring of news and entertainment feel more relevant than ever. @BryanCranston, @TonyGoldwyn, and @TatianaMaslany are wonderful in it. Go see it at the Belasco Theatre if you can.
When Kavanaugh called birth control "abortion-inducing drugs," he made it clear that safe and legal abortion isn't the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed. Access to birth control is, too.
YES! 
In honor of National Voter Registration Day, I want to highlight some  tools you can use to get registered to vote and register friends. With only six weeks before the election, it's all hands on deck.
"This is a woman who really does care." 
"He may be up at 3am, but it’s because he’s tweeting insults at somebody who got under his skin.” —@POTUS on Trump
"It’s not just what we’re against that should motivate you to go to the polls.It’s what we are for.” —Hillary 
As we mourn another school shooting and yet more tragic, needless deaths, let's resolve to act. Brian is right. Donate to @SwingLeft's Senate Fund to win back the majority and put urgent gun safety legislation in place: 
I'm so happy to see candidates winning the right to use campaign funds for child care. We need more moms in office. 
On #WorldTeachersDay, it's not enough to appreciate teachers. We have to support them like America's future is in their hands—because it is. 
We set out to do this nationally, but thrilled that New York is getting it done. Let's hope it's the first of many. Text College to 81336. 
We passed bipartisan comprehensive reform when I was a senator, but House Republicans killed it. Since then, the GOP has refused to make progress and instead uses the issue to divide our country.
Donald Trump refused to say that he’d respect the results of this election.That’s a direct threat to our democracy.
Congratulations Tammy! 
Today is #EqualPayDay, marking how far into 2019 women have to work to match men's earnings from 2018. It's a good day to call your senators and ask them to support the Paycheck Fairness Act: 

When people ask me what we should do now, my answer is clear: The most important thing you can do is vote in every election.

If they win, they’ll do great things for America. Let's exercise our birthright as Americans today, put those people in office, and continue the hard work of saving our democracy. It'll take all of us. Happy Election Day.
In Mike Pence's defense, we wouldn't want to defend Donald Trump, either. #VPDebate 
Every American has the right to voice their support for democracy and human rights for Hong Kong. Full stop.
Right here. Includes radical provisions like how not to kick 23 mil ppl off their coverage. Feel free to run w/it. 
If you’ve already voted, jump on the phone and remind voters in key battleground states to go vote:  
First, some history. The 2013 Supreme Court case Shelby v. Holder gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act by ruling that states with a history of voter suppression no longer needed the federal government to approve changes to voting rules.
We've made extraordinary progress under @POTUS. On November 8, that progress is on the ballot. 
Today at noon: Speak out and fight back to protest the wave of recent abortion bans. Find an event near you:  #StopTheBans
"It is great to be in the state that’s going to send Hillary Clinton to the White House!” —@ElizabethForMA in New Hampshire
The Iranian people, especially the young, are protesting for the freedom and future they deserve. I hope their government responds peacefully and supports their hopes.
Bill and I are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend Ellen Tauscher. Ellen woke up every day determined to make a difference, and make a difference she did. 
Take a moment today to help. Call your representatives and urge them to vote yes on the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, which would help protect families in detention and make sure they are treated with respect: 202-224-3121 #UntilEveryFamilyIsReunited 
"All that progress is at stake if we don't do the right thing over these last 19 days." —@POTUS 
I’m really concerned for North and South Carolinians dealing with such dangerous flooding. Please heed the latest warnings &amp; stay safe. -H
Hurricane #Matthew is a major storm. I urge everyone to follow emergency instructions and evacuate if you're told to. Stay safe Florida. -H 
Georgians, spread the word: The deadline is 5pm today for people who voted with paper ballots to make sure their votes are counted. 
Trump talks tough on trade and Chinese steel hurting American workers—but he bought Chinese steel for two of his last three buildings.
Mayor Ed Lee’s death is a terrible loss for the people of San Francisco. He was a good friend &amp; a vocal advocate for the city he served &amp; loved. My thoughts are with his family.
We believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love, you have the right to be treated equally.
Bill’s speech brought tears to my eyes. Wanted to share it. Watch if you want to be inspired today. 
An icon turns 50. Jay-Z's story is as American a tale as they come—full of poetry, hard work, and pushing for progress on issues he cares about. (For more, I recommend @MichaelEDyson's definitive biography.) Happy birthday, @S_C_! 
Today, we remember #Parkland and the 17 people whose lives were cruelly taken at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High two years ago. In the words of @AMarch4OurLives: "We remember them with love. We honor them with action."
In America, we build bridges, not walls.Let’s go out and prove that love trumps hate. 
“Changing the type of people who are empowered to run for office, manage campaigns, and move up in elected office does not happen automatically.” New research from the Pipeline Initiative on what stops people from running, and what we can all do to help:  
Then, find out when and where you'll vote. Depending on where you live, your state might make early voting available. Minnesota is already casting ballots! 
No matter where we or our ancestors are from, millions of Americans will sit down together to break bread today. It's a wonderful reminder that our country is both a place and an idea—where anyone can find a home to breathe free. Happy Thanksgiving!
I'm disgusted by legislators' refusal to address the reality that this equipment needs to be regulated. We don’t need any more evidence that lives are at stake, and 12 more people just paid a terrible price for continuing inaction.
He said that “In the immigration context, the government has never taken a stand against the protection of kids in this country. For the first time, it is now formally taking a position that explicitly goes against the best interests of kids.”
My new afterword for "What Happened" is excerpted in @TheAtlantic. It's about the constitutional crisis building in our democracy and why we should all be focused, determined and, yes, optimistic as we work to save our country. 
This week we lost 17 Americans in Parkland - the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook in 2012. Since then, 438 people have been shot and 138 killed in over 230 school shootings. That’s 5 school shootings every month, 16 of which classify as “mass shootings.”
Some background: All branches of the U.S. government use the State Department's human rights reports to shape policy and inform decision-making around diplomacy and allocations of aid and security.
If you read one thing before tonight's debate, make it this: 
I, our country, and Twitter will miss @JohnDingell’s quick wit, good heart, and profound sense of patriotism. My thoughts are with @RepDebDingell, the whole Dingell family, and the wide community of friends, constituents, and fellow Americans who admired and respected him.
No parent should pay more than 10% of their income on quality child care.

“When the going gets tough, Hillary is the person we want on our side because she never gives up. She never quits.” —@FLOTUS
In 2017, the Women’s March was a beacon of hope and defiance. In 2018, it is a testament to the power and resilience of women everywhere. Let’s show that same power in the voting booth this year. #PowerToThePolls

On the one hand, the president makes nonstop outlandish claims in his recent @ABC interview about my campaign and Russia. On the other hand: Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, and the entire Mueller report.
I enjoyed telling @annfriedman about one of the many times I'm glad I followed my mother's advice. Eighteen years old and away from home for the first time, I considered leaving Wellesley College. Mom told me to stick with it. I'm so glad I did. 
Diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection. It is the balancing of risk. So far, the administration has consciously chosen a dangerous path leading to a riskier future. But diplomacy is still the only way for the administration to climb out of the hole they’ve dug.
Voting should be easy. But as we saw with seven-hour lines in Texas on Tuesday, Republicans put up barriers to voters casting their ballots. We've got to fight back and win, and @marceelias is showing the way. Join the fight:  #DemocracyDocket

Thank you, @StaceyAbrams, for fighting for Georgia and for the integrity of our elections. Everyone should be able to exercise their right to vote. Every vote should be counted.
The Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful and wealthy. 
Never heard of a “blue collar worker” losing nearly $1 billion in a year and cheating hundreds of other workers in the process. 
Her U.S. asylum officer opens up the State Department's human rights reports and finds no information about those 17 women imprisoned for miscarrying or El Salvador's abortion ban. He deems she has no credible fear of persecution if she returns home. He denies her application.
More people are voting in this election than ever before. Make a plan to vote today:  
In 2018, @LatinoVictoryUS increased their endorsed candidates 500% over the previous year. Of their 58 candidates, 43 candidates won, bringing their 2018 win rate to a whopping 74%. The number of Democratic Latina members of Congress nearly doubled.
Kids in Need of Defense, @supportKIND, represents unaccompanied children in court and gives them a chance to be reunited with their families. 
Trump said pregnancy is an inconvenience for employers.He dismisses the pay gap.He said wages are too high.He wants to defund @PPact.
Happy Labor Day. There's no better time to talk about why workers’ rights would suffer if Brett Kavanaugh, whose hearings for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court start tomorrow, is confirmed.
"You wanna give me a good send off? Go knock on some doors.” —@POTUS:

Florida in the rain. 
Grateful to the Senate Finance Committee for passing a strong and much needed bipartisan reauthorization bill. Now, let's get this done. 6/7
For 30 years, @JoeBiden has known Hillary as a public servant, global leader, and friend. Here's why he's with her: 
"Hillary knows that our country is powerful and vibrant and strong—big enough to have a place for all of us." —@FLOTUS
Our neighbors in battleground states need your help. Make calls to remind Hillary supporters to go vote: 
I'm grateful to the members of Congress who have visited camps at the border over the last couple of days to hold a light to the nightmarish conditions there. We need more oversight. We need accountability. We need them now.
Puerto Ricans, united, shall never be defeated. 🇵🇷 
"Less than 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote. Look how far we’ve come.” —@Beyonce 
We’ve got to take on discrimination &amp; bigotry.We can’t accept as normal what we’re seeing across this country because of Trump’s campaign.
Support Samantha Bee &amp; Planned Parenthood &amp; buy a Nasty Woman t-shirt! 
Hillary's advice to girls everywhere:"There's nothing wrong with knowing what you want and going after it." 
"I was denied an apartment in the Trump buildings based on the color of my skin."This is Mae Wiggins's story: 
In 2001, Hillary worked to support and rebuild New York after 9/11. Trump pocketed emergency funds for himself.  
Forty-six years after Roe v. Wade, we reaffirm what will always be true: Women have an unalienable right to make their own decisions about their health care. 
It will also be harder to deal with other threats like ballistic missiles and terrorism. Now we have no leverage and Iran is free to do what it wants. Read what President Obama wrote about it here:
The administration is now seven weeks late in meeting its deadline to reunite families they separated at the border. Hundreds of families have spent the past seven weeks waiting and worrying. There's no possible excuse for continuing to keep them apart. #FamiliesBelongTogether
“As we look into the eyes of our children...the stakes in this election could not be more clear.” —@FLOTUS
There are over 400,000 kids in America's foster care system. A small thing you can do to help: Talk about it.

"Racism and sexism and bigotry have no place in our country.” —@ElizabethForMA in New Hampshire
.@FLOTUS, I'm in awe. Thanks for putting into words what's in so many of our hearts. -H
You go girl! This is important; costs will go up, &amp; powerful companies will get more powerful. We can’t let it slip through the cracks. 
Last week, Sheriff Joe Arpaio was charged with contempt of court for racially profiling Latinos.Donald Trump supports him.
The next Supreme Court justice could shift the court to the right for decades, with devastating consequences for reproductive rights, health care, workers' rights, and voting rights.
Happy #Juneteenth. Let's celebrate our victories and communities as we keep working for a more perfect union.
"He demeans and humiliates women as if we're objects...rather than human beings worthy of love and respect." —@FLOTUS on Trump
I'm so sorry to hear of Freia David’s passing. I came to know her story when the Boston Globe reported on how a little retirement party to mark 32 years at McDonald's became a 100-person celebration, so loved was Freia. Her life reaffirmed our differences only make us stronger.
Terrifying. #DebateNight 
If Hillary tried to fact-check Donald in real time, she wouldn't have time for anything else. So, here:  #debate
"Hombres"? #DebateNight
“I believe America’s best days are still ahead of us.” —Hillary 
I’m so honored to be giving the commencement at @Hunter_College today. See you this afternoon at MSG!
Trump: "Health care—why didn't she do something about it?"Here's Hillary in 1993, testifying for health care reform. #debate 
This #SpiritDay, let's take a stand for LGBT youth and send a clear message to all our kids: In the end, bullies always lose. -H 
With Republican secretaries of state pursuing voter suppression tactics in states across the country, it's more important than ever that we elect officials who will make sure every eligible citizen can vote. Kudos to @iVoteFund and @KatieHobbs. 
Share stories of the families who are being torn apart by these policies. We all need to be clear as Americans about what's being done in our name, and how we can work together to fix it. 
Donate your time or money to their campaigns if you can. Our government should represent us, and Congress is only 20% women right now. Let's change that ratio!
One thing I’m grateful for are vaccines that save lives. Let’s all do our part to counter anti-vaccination disinformation that threatens lives. 
The reports of crackdowns on protesters, overflowing hospitals, and internet blackouts in Iran are very disturbing. The situation calls for investigations and accountability.
A person who implies that veterans suffering from PTS are not "strong" is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief. Period. 
Don't stand still. Vote today:  #ElectionDay #MannequinChallenge 
Two-year-olds in detention. Children forced to take care of other children. Not enough food or water. Demand accountability from your Republican representatives for allowing this administration to cage children and keep them in unconscionable conditions. 
"We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America—and I always will." —Hillary
Our metric for success should be how many kids can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them. 
If you've got Hillary's back, tonight is the night to show it. Chip in before the debate to say you're with her: 
Chelsea &amp; I wrote a book called Grandma’s Gardens about Chelsea's gardening with my mom &amp; my gardening with my grandkids. I can't wait until we can all safely spend time outside with our loved ones again—and we'll look forward to sharing more with you when this crisis is over. 🌸 
It's been three weeks since the deadline for the administration to reunify families it separated at the border. Today, 565 children are still reportedly separated from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Bill, Chelsea, and I loved seeing @hbrikin's beautiful play #WhatTheConstitutionMeansToMe at @NYTW79. It's an empowering call to consider what it means to be a citizen. Go see it at the Greenwich House Theater if you can!
.@Schwarzenegger is right: Nearly 60 million Americans live under the rule of a party that didn't win the majority of their votes. And we need to fix it. 
Momentous news in world health: The 2 billionth lifesaving, insecticide-treated mosquito net will be distributed this year. Global cooperation and U.S. leadership has helped millions of children in Africa grow up malaria-free.  #EndMalaria 
Let's all keep the brave sailors of the USS Fitzgerald in our thoughts &amp; prayers this weekend.
A movie recommendation as you #StayHome this weekend: “Slay the Dragon” is an inspiring new film from @participant about how America falls short of every vote counting equally—and how all of us can fight back. It begins streaming today. 
"My vision for America is an America where everyone has a place. This is the America that I know and love." —Hillary 
If a candidate begins his career running a company that discriminates against people of color, what kind of president will he be? 
New Yorkers and Oklahomans: Today is your last chance to register to vote. Take two minutes now to check your registration, and nudge friends to do the same—don't let them miss their chance to vote. 
"I sorta get away with things like that." —Donald Trump, on bursting into Miss Universe pageant dressing rooms 
One of my favorite @ClintonFdn podcast conversations to date:The Honorable, the notorious, and the seriously gutsy Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
By requiring annual reporting on women's access to basic health care like contraception, safe abortion, and maternal health care around the world, Congress can make sure the rights of women and girls will no longer be up for grabs in each election.
“I can’t believe I’m saying a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women.” —@FLOTUS
"Trump is the worst major-party candidate this republic has ever produced." —@ForeignPolicy 
.@OnwardTogether partners @SwingLeft, @ArenaSummit, and @RunForSomething are on the case. Join the fight to win back legislative chambers in nine critical states in 2020:  
The Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health care for 9 million kids &amp; has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis every year for almost 2 decades, is hanging in limbo because Congress let it expire over 2 months ago.
What a wonderful sight this is. 
If Republicans prevail in court:- 20 million people will lose coverage- Protections for pre-existing conditions will be gone- Young people won't be able to stay on their parents' plans until age 26- Limits on coverage will return- Caps on out-of-pocket expenses will be gone
Here's how Trump reacts when he loses an Emmy, the Iowa caucus, a primary, and polls. So yeah, he seems fit for the presidency. #DebateNight 
“We cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative.” —@FLOTUS:  
After his lawyers advised against it, Trump used a "legally dubious" strategy to avoid paying taxes for years. 
Found my emails at the Venice Biennale. Someone alert the House GOP. 
"When your children and grandchildren ask what you did in 2016...I hope you’ll say you voted for a better America.” —Hillary
RT this to make sure everyone you know is registered to vote:  #Debate 
So thrilled to be giving the commencement at @ARMathSciArts today. You can tune in here: 
Captain Humayun Khan died serving his country—and saving his entire unit.Trump seems to think someone like him doesn't belong in America. 
There are a lot of bullies in this world. The last thing we need is one in the White House. 
“I learned that preparation is important.” —Hillary on what she learned by debating Donald Trump
We counted: Over the last three presidential debates, Donald Trump told 137 lies. Hillary still won all three. 
Hillary’s in Ohio with just 8 days left in the campaign. Watch live: 
"You can go vote early right now. Early voting started on Wednesday...go to  —@POTUS in Ohio
In which @realDonaldTrump basically proves our point. 
I had the great honor of serving alongside Kay Hagan. She was a vibrant, intelligent, and effective Senator, a lifelong champion of women, and a beloved daughter of North Carolina.We will miss her dearly.
"Kids and families have been the passion of my life—and they'll be the heart of my presidency." 
Who inspires you this #InternationalWomensDay?
Based on my work, this is a good example for us to consider. The goal has to be quality, affordable universal health care for everyone. 
The GOP wants to break their bipartisan pledge &amp; cut funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program to pay for their tax cuts to the wealthy &amp; corporations. We must take care of our children. Experts &amp; doctors agree. Lots of them: 
Grateful for this progress even as we all know that every additional day of delay is a tragedy. 
A big thank you to Toria Nuland, Maria Otero, Eric Schwartz, Roberta Jacobson and my old friend @melanneverveer for a terrific discussion on how we conduct values-driven foreign policy. 
New Yorkers: Please make sure folks in your community know about this program!

Seriously, you asked Russia to hack me on national television. 
I'm on @Columbia's beautiful campus tonight for a conversation with President Lee Bollinger. You can watch live here: 
It was a historic night in so many ways: For the first time ever, over 100 women were elected to Congress—including a record number of women of color.
.@WhipClyburn and his wife Emily met in 1960 after being arrested at a civil rights protest. After hours in jail, Jim was hungry. A woman he'd never met came over with a burger and gave him half. That was Emily: Fierce advocate, generous soul, Jim’s true partner. We’ll miss her.
LGBT kids are perfect exactly the way they are. #BornPerfect 
We had our best analysts create a calculator to see how much you'd pay in taxes if you paid the same as Trump: 
Go to  to see how much Hillary’s college plan could help you save.
John McCain is as tough as they come.  Thinking of John, Cindy, their wonderful children, &amp; their whole family tonight.
Trump owes President Obama an apology for his years-long racist conspiracy. And by the way: "Sorry if you were offended" doesn't count.
Americans’ wages just hit an all-time high.We need to build on this progress—not turn back: 
Young women can run the world. These are the stories of some who did—including HFA alum @arosaflores! 
And with the help of @collectivepac, 23 African-American candidates have been elected to local, state, and federal offices since August 2016.
Great news: Nevada's Democratic-led (and female-majority!) state legislature passed a bill to restore voting rights for 77,000 formerly incarcerated people. 
“We’ve got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that we deserve.” —Hillary
Just returned from marching in the annual Chappaqua Memorial Day Parade with everyone from Governors to Girls Scouts. Today we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country to keep us safe here at home. 
Trump wouldn't say if he'll accept the outcome of the election. That’s horrifying—but part of a pattern. 
If you want to join a political campaign this year but don’t know where to start, consider Onward Together partner @arenasummit’s Arena Academy this April in Charleston, SC. It's a great way to learn the ropes. Apply by March 1: 
This is a deliberate and ongoing effort to silence millions of Americans.Protecting the right to vote in America will be the single most important fight of our time. 
Every day Stephen Miller remains in the White House is an emergency. 
Don't throw away your shot: Support the progressive work of @OnwardTogether and join me for a Broadway play in New York, flights and hotel on us! Enter here:  
It's incredible that this has to be said: Letting thousands of people needlessly suffer and die is wrong. It's also not a recipe for rescuing the economy.
.@RunforSomething put together a candidate support kit with resources for state and local candidates who need to find new ways to reach voters. 
When she was sworn in as Finland's new prime minister yesterday, @marinsanna became the world's youngest prime minister—and the head of a coalition government led entirely by women. Hyvä Suomi! 🇫🇮 
At 103, Ruline Steininger had an energy &amp; vibrancy all should aspire to. My thoughts &amp; prayers are w/ her family.
Bill, Chelsea and I are excited to meet a @ClintonFdn supporter next month in New York! Your support helps change lives around the world—hope you'll throw your hat in the ring to join us: 
Join me live this morning at 9:45am for an important discussion about child &amp; adolescent mental health, focused on solutions for families &amp; communities. #ChildMindSummit 
"Everything I’ve done started by listening to people…working to bring people together, to find common ground.” —Hillary in North Carolina
On this day, we don't remember the destruction of Pearl Harbor. We remember the selflessness Americans showed that day as they risked themselves to save their fellow servicemembers, and we remember the resilience that followed. To all who served and sacrificed, thank you.
Five @EmergeAmerica alumni are headed to Congress, and 145 were elected to state legislatures. Emerge alums also helped put an end to the Republican supermajorities in the Michigan and Pennsylvania senates.
Call Congress @ (202) 224-3121. Tell them we must work together to get this done for the children &amp; families counting on CHIP. 7/7
Trump has built his campaign on demonizing Latinos and immigrants.Latino voters have the power to stop him. Vote:
