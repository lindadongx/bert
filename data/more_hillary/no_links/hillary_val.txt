The administration just put a gag rule in place that bars Title X health care providers from referring patients for safe and legal abortions. It's an attack on Planned Parenthood and 1.6 million patients who may not be able to afford care anywhere else. #IStandWithPP #NoGagRule
First: We‚Äôve got to mobilize turnout in the midterms. There are fantastic candidates all over the country who‚Äôll do great things, and we could finally see some congressional oversight of the White House.
We are seeing large numbers of people turning out, breaking records.Make sure you‚Äôre ready to vote, too: 
Sen. @kamalaharris asked Brett Kavanaugh last week: "Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?" He said he was not. Because there are none.

It's more important than ever this week to remember the children who have still not been reunited with their families after this administration separated them at the border months ago. Vote to repudiate this horrendous policy. Vote to reject the bigotry that led to it.
When Trump trivializes the sacrifice of our military and veterans, he makes it clear: He has no idea what service to this country means. 
At least 32 million nurses, caregivers, and food service workers in America don't have access to any paid sick leave. It's morally wrong and, as the coronavirus crisis makes clear, it puts us all at risk. 
Russia‚Äôs seizure last week of three Ukrainian boats and their 24 crew members in the Kerch Strait is a significant Russian military escalation with respect to Ukraine and the latest attempt by Russia to control key areas in and around Ukraine.
They tell me about 10% of first-time candidates usually win, but 40% of @runforsomething candidates came out on top yesterday.

Under @jacindaardern's leadership, New Zealand has banned assault rifles and military-style semi-automatic weapons just six days after the Christchurch mosque attacks. Public servants didn't stop at offering thoughts and prayers. They chose to act. 
Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, is overseeing his own election for governor and has put 53,000 voter registrations on hold, 70% of them from black voters, because they don't adhere to an "exact match" standard of name spellings.

When Kavanaugh called birth control "abortion-inducing drugs," he made it clear that safe and legal abortion isn't the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed. Access to birth control is, too.

Diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection. It is the balancing of risk. So far, the administration has consciously chosen a dangerous path leading to a riskier future. But diplomacy is still the only way for the administration to climb out of the hole they‚Äôve dug.

Forty-six years after Roe v. Wade, we reaffirm what will always be true: Women have an unalienable right to make their own decisions about their health care. 
It will also be harder to deal with other threats like ballistic missiles and terrorism. Now we have no leverage and Iran is free to do what it wants. Read what President Obama wrote about it here:

Our metric for success should be how many kids can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them. 
If you've got Hillary's back, tonight is the night to show it. Chip in before the debate to say you're with her: 
Chelsea &amp; I wrote a book called Grandma‚Äôs Gardens about Chelsea's gardening with my mom &amp; my gardening with my grandkids. I can't wait until we can all safely spend time outside with our loved ones again‚Äîand we'll look forward to sharing more with you when this crisis is over. üå∏ 
It's been three weeks since the deadline for the administration to reunify families it separated at the border. Today, 565 children are still reportedly separated from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Bill, Chelsea, and I loved seeing @hbrikin's beautiful play #WhatTheConstitutionMeansToMe at @NYTW79. It's an empowering call to consider what it means to be a citizen. Go see it at the Greenwich House Theater if you can!
.@Schwarzenegger is right: Nearly 60 million Americans live under the rule of a party that didn't win the majority of their votes. And we need to fix it. 
Momentous news in world health: The 2 billionth lifesaving, insecticide-treated mosquito net will be distributed this year. Global cooperation and U.S. leadership has helped millions of children in Africa grow up malaria-free.  #EndMalaria

A movie recommendation as you #StayHome this weekend: ‚ÄúSlay the Dragon‚Äù is an inspiring new film from @participant about how America falls short of every vote counting equally‚Äîand how all of us can fight back. It begins streaming today. 
"My vision for America is an America where everyone has a place. This is the America that I know and love." ‚ÄîHillary 
If a candidate begins his career running a company that discriminates against people of color, what kind of president will he be? 
New Yorkers and Oklahomans: Today is your last chance to register to vote. Take two minutes now to check your registration, and nudge friends to do the same‚Äîdon't let them miss their chance to vote. 
"I sorta get away with things like that." ‚ÄîDonald Trump, on bursting into Miss Universe pageant dressing rooms 
One of my favorite @ClintonFdn podcast conversations to date:The Honorable, the notorious, and the seriously gutsy Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
By requiring annual reporting on women's access to basic health care like contraception, safe abortion, and maternal health care around the world, Congress can make sure the rights of women and girls will no longer be up for grabs in each election.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women.‚Äù ‚Äî@FLOTUS

.@OnwardTogether partners @SwingLeft, @ArenaSummit, and @RunForSomething are on the case. Join the fight to win back legislative chambers in nine critical states in 2020:  
The Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health care for 9 million kids &amp; has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis every year for almost 2 decades, is hanging in limbo because Congress let it expire over 2 months ago.
What a wonderful sight this is. 
If Republicans prevail in court:- 20 million people will lose coverage- Protections for pre-existing conditions will be gone- Young people won't be able to stay on their parents' plans until age 26- Limits on coverage will return- Caps on out-of-pocket expenses will be gone
Here's how Trump reacts when he loses an Emmy, the Iowa caucus, a primary, and polls. So yeah, he seems fit for the presidency. #DebateNight 
‚ÄúWe cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative.‚Äù ‚Äî@FLOTUS:  
After his lawyers advised against it, Trump used a "legally dubious" strategy to avoid paying taxes for years. 
Found my emails at the Venice Biennale. Someone alert the House GOP.

There are a lot of bullies in this world. The last thing we need is one in the White House. 
‚ÄúI learned that preparation is important.‚Äù ‚ÄîHillary on what she learned by debating Donald Trump
We counted: Over the last three presidential debates, Donald Trump told 137 lies. Hillary still won all three.

"Kids and families have been the passion of my life‚Äîand they'll be the heart of my presidency." 
Who inspires you this #InternationalWomensDay?
Based on my work, this is a good example for us to consider. The goal has to be quality, affordable universal health care for everyone. 
The GOP wants to break their bipartisan pledge &amp; cut funding for the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program to pay for their tax cuts to the wealthy &amp; corporations. We must take care of our children. Experts &amp; doctors agree. Lots of them: 
Grateful for this progress even as we all know that every additional day of delay is a tragedy. 
A big thank you to Toria Nuland, Maria Otero, Eric Schwartz, Roberta Jacobson and my old friend @melanneverveer for a terrific discussion on how we conduct values-driven foreign policy.

.@WhipClyburn and his wife Emily met in 1960 after being arrested at a civil rights protest. After hours in jail, Jim was hungry. A woman he'd never met came over with a burger and gave him half. That was Emily: Fierce advocate, generous soul, Jim‚Äôs true partner. We‚Äôll miss her.
LGBT kids are perfect exactly the way they are. #BornPerfect 
We had our best analysts create a calculator to see how much you'd pay in taxes if you paid the same as Trump: 
Go to  to see how much Hillary‚Äôs college plan could help you save.
John McCain is as tough as they come.  Thinking of John, Cindy, their wonderful children, &amp; their whole family tonight.
Trump owes President Obama an apology for his years-long racist conspiracy. And by the way: "Sorry if you were offended" doesn't count.
Americans‚Äô wages just hit an all-time high.We need to build on this progress‚Äînot turn back:

Just returned from marching in the annual Chappaqua Memorial Day Parade with everyone from Governors to Girls Scouts. Today we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country to keep us safe here at home. 
Trump wouldn't say if he'll accept the outcome of the election. That‚Äôs horrifying‚Äîbut part of a pattern.

When she was sworn in as Finland's new prime minister yesterday, @marinsanna became the world's youngest prime minister‚Äîand the head of a coalition government led entirely by women. Hyv√§ Suomi! üá´üáÆ

On this day, we don't remember the destruction of Pearl Harbor. We remember the selflessness Americans showed that day as they risked themselves to save their fellow servicemembers, and we remember the resilience that followed. To all who served and sacrificed, thank you.
