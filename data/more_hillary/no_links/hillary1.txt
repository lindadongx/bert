"No matter where life takes me I always remember I am the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small business owner."
This wasn't an anomaly for Trump. His economic plan helps millionaires and hurts middle-class families. He'd let Wall Street run wild again.

America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look or worship a certain way.

Donald Trump's plan on immigration has been clear all along: demonize immigrants, "build a wall," deport millions. 
We think Trump's been involved in more than 5,500 lawsuits. We're going to try and read them all in 4 hours: 
So proud of you, Karla.
The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can't be unwritten.

Some of the (many, many) reasons Donald Trump isn't fit to be Commander-in-Chief.

"Speaking is hard for me, but come January, I want to say these two words: Madam President." —@

We have two names to add to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.
.@realDonaldTrump has written a lot of books about business, but they all seem to end at Chapter 11.
Donald Trump proves every day that he’s not in it for the American people—he’s in it only for himself. 
We made history tonight—but we have more work to do. Chip in if you've got Hillary's back: 
Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. What that would mean: his family gets a $4 billion tax cut. 99.8% of Americans get nothing.
Again, Trump turns his faults on others. Psychologists call it "projecting." Kids call it "I'm rubber, you're glue." 
We don't just believe in a country where no one is left out or left behind—we're making it a reality.
"We can build on a strong progressive tradition from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama." —Hillary

Don’t let anyone tell you that America isn’t great. Donald Trump’s got America all wrong.
In America, it doesn’t matter where your parents were born or what color your skin is. We should be judged by words and deeds—not our race.
Taking care of our veterans is part of our solemn duty as Americans:  
Trump's dangerously wrong when he says “I alone can fix it.”Americans haver never put our faith in one man—we put our faith in each other.
What our economy needs: The largest investment in creating good-paying jobs since World War II. 
Trump's called for a new tax loophole—the Trump Loophole. He'd pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies.
Happening now: Watch @FLOTUS speak at the #DemConvention:

We need a president who will unite leaders around the world to defeat ISIS, not one who insults and alienates them. 
"When I’m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can’t." Hillary in NC today: 
Anyone who looks at the African American community and sees only poverty, crime, and despair is missing so much. 
Trump is attacking a judge based on his heritage because Trump thinks *he's* the victim of bias here. 
Hillary's new college plan will help more students, especially students of color, afford college: 
Paid family leave isn't a luxury. Families shouldn't have to choose between eating and caring for loved ones. 
We need to start listening to each other.Hearing each other.Walking in each other’s shoes.
Does Trump pay his fair share in taxes? As long as he keeps refusing to release his tax returns, voters won't know. 
In the spirit of the #Charleston9, let’s bridge our divides, fight for change, and remember that love never fails.
