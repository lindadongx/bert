This week we lost 17 Americans in Parkland - the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook in 2012. Since then, 438 people have been shot and 138 killed in over 230 school shootings. That‚Äôs 5 school shootings every month, 16 of which classify as ‚Äúmass shootings.‚Äù
Some background: All branches of the U.S. government use the State Department's human rights reports to shape policy and inform decision-making around diplomacy and allocations of aid and security.
