So in these surreal times, let’s rally together &amp; take action.  Call your House and Senate members at 202-224-3121 and tell them to take care of kids now and protect our seniors, the poor &amp; vulnerable from future attacks. Tell them that it’s the very least they can do.
Not only that - this administration built on their "zero tolerance" policy earlier this month. The result? Nearly 700 more kids were separated from their families in the first two weeks of the new program. Think about that. Hundreds of families torn apart in two weeks.
Sometimes it’s hard to know what to do after a loss. Not this time. This tax bill is only going to get worse as people learn more about it. There are 6 GOP Senators that have to run on it &amp; 2 open seats in 2018.  We all need to get to work.

Let's be clear: This administration's dehumanization and cruelty toward migrants will not stop after Kirstjen Nielsen leaves office. It is their principal policy.

A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.
Last week, every senator swore to "do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws" in the president's impeachment trial.Last night, Republican senators cast vote after vote to block evidence and testimony.The American people deserve a real trial, not a cover-up.
My thoughts are with everyone affected by this morning’s horrific shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We can and must put a stop to this violence and this hate. It should have no home in America.
